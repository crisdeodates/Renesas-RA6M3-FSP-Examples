# This file is used to specify a set of API header files for the NSC functions defined in your application code.
# These header files will be copied into the Smart Bundle and subsequently extracted into each non-secure project
# that uses the bundle.
# Each file should be specified on a single line using a path that is relative to the project location.
# E.g. header/nsc.h

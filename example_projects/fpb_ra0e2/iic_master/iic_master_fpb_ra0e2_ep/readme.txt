1. Project Overview:
	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the IIC master HAL module APIs.
	The project initializes IIC master module with standard rate and interfaces with PmodACL Board for ADXL345.
	On power up after establishing the connection of sensor with RA board, it displays accelerometer axis data on
	RTT Viewer. Any API/event failure will be displayed on RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x PmodACL.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	4 x Jumper wires used to connect the RA board to the PmodACL.

Note:
1) For the functioning of IIC Master on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, FPB-RA6E1, FPB-RA4E1, EK-RA8M1,
   FPB-RA2E3, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1 external pull up resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7K ohms are required
   to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.ï»¿

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x2000460c
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

4) For GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: To enable printing floats to RTT Viewer, edit the project settings and ensure that
   "Use float with nano printf" is enabled. The setting can be found by:
   Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings > GNU Arm Cross C Linker > Miscellaneous > Use float with nano printf

# Introduction #
The Example Project demonstrates the basic functionality of the UARTA driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on FSP, the Virtual COM is used as example usage of the UARTA. The user can select UARTA baud rate from the menu on J-Link RTT Viewer (e.g., 9600 bps, 14400 bps, 19200 bps,...). After the UARTA is initialized successfully, a message prompts the user to open and configure parameters for Tera Term on PC. Then the user can enter and send an ASCII string (up to 256 characters) from Tera Term to the RA board, which will also be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer and echoed back to Tera Term by the RA board. Additionally, the EP information and any error messages will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

        * To echo back characters typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].  
        * To make sure the received data shows properly, the user needs to set [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> [Receive: CR + LF].  
        * The configuration parameters of the serial port on the terminal application are as follows:  
            * COM port is provided by the J-Link on-board.  
			* Baud rate: Base on the user's selection. 
			* Data length: 8-bits    
			* Parity: none

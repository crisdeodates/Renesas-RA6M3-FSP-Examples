# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the basic usage of SAU SPI driver. The project writes commands to the slave digital thermometer module, and reads the temperature values using SAU SPI bus configured as master. The temperature values are continuously printed on J-Link RTT Viewer. Status information and error messages will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer during the execution of the project.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

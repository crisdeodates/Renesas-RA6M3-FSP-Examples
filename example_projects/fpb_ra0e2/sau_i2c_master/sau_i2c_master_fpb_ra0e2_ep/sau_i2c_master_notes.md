# Introduction #
The example project demonstrates the typical use of the SAU I2C master HAL module APIs. The project initializes the SAU I2C master module with the standard rate of 100 kHz and communicates with the PmodACL Board for ADXL345.

On power-up, after initializing the SAU I2C master module and configuring the ADXL345 sensor, the RA MCU will read the axis acceleration data from the sensor and display it on the RTT Viewer every time new data is detected by an external interrupt.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

## Special Topics ##
* The files sau_i2c_master_ep.c and sau_i2c_master_ep.h contains the API for initialization, configuration and communication of the PmodACL module.
* For the functioning of the SAU I2C Master:
  1. SDA pin and SCL pin must configure output type as n-ch open drain.
  2. SDA pin and SCL pin must be connected to external pull-up resistors.
  3. The value of the external pull-up resistor depends on the I2C bus speed. In this EP, the I2C bus is configured at standard speed of 100 kHz, so the recommended external pull-up resistor value is from 1k to 4.7k ohms.

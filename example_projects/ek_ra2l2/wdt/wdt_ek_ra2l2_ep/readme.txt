1. Project Overview:
   	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the WDT HAL module APIs.
   	The user can give input through J-Link RTT Viewer to start the WDT. The WDT is refreshed periodically through GPT timer.
   	The user can press the push button to stop the GPT timer which in turn stops refreshing the WDT timer.
   	Approximately after 2 seconds, the WDT resets the MCU and turns the LED ON until the user gives the input once again.

2. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA2A1, EK-RA2E1, EK-RA2L1, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5,
	    EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2, FPB-RA4E1, FPB-RA6E1, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA2L2 boards:
		Use Switch S1 to stop the WDT from refreshing.

	For EK-RA4W1 board:
		Use Switch SW1 to stop the WDT from refreshing.

	For EK-RA2E2, RSSK-RA6T1, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, MCK-RA6T2, EK-RA2A2, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 boards:
		Use Switch S2 to stop the WDT from refreshing.

	For FPB-RA2E3 board:
		Connect wire to short P200/NMI (J3:21) to P206 (J3:18).
		Use Switch S1 to stop the WDT from refreshing.

	For MCK-RA8T1 board:
		Connect Pmod BTN (J1:1) to PMOD (CN6:1).
		Use Switch BTN1 (push button on Pmod BTN) to stop the WDT from refreshing.ï»¿

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x20004898
   b. Keil:	0x20004820
   c. IAR: 0x200048b4
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

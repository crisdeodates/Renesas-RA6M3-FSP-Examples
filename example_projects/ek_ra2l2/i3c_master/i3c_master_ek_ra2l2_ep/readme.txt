1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the typical use of the I3C Driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
	The I3C master on RA board demonstrates operations associated with an I3C slave running on another RA board.
	Once initialization is successful, I3C Master device assigns slave address to I3C slave device through DAA
	(dynamic address assignment) using I3C common command code (CCC). Once Dynamic Address Assignment is completed,
	the Master EP performs write/read operations and displays slave device information based on the user input. If the
	on-board switch is pressed on the slave side, it will initiate an IBI transfer request. Error and info messages
	will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.
	
	Note: EK-RA8D1 supports I3C HDR-DDR mode. The Master EP can perform write/read operations both in the SDR mode 
	      and HDR-DDR mode.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA2E2, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA2L2.
	2 x Renesas RA boards.
 	2 x Micro USB cables for programming and debugging. 
	5 x Jumper wires to link RA boards.
	1 x Pull up resistor of value 1k, 3.9k or 4.7k ohms.

4. Hardware Configurations:
	For EK-RA8M1: Install jumper J61 to enable I3C.

	For EK-RA8D1: Set the configuration switches (SW1) as below to avoid potential failures.
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		| SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		|     OFF     |     OFF     |      OFF     |     OFF    |     OFF    |     OFF    |     OFF     |     OFF   |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+	

	For EK-RA4L1: The user needs to turn OFF S4-5 to enable I3C function.

Note: 
1) External 3V3 pull-up using 1k, 3.9k or 4.7k ohms resistor should be connected on SDA line. Change external 3V3 pull-up
   using 1K ohms resistor for EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA2L2.

2) On slave side the user can perform IBI transfer request using onboard Push button (S2).
   For MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3: The user needs to use Toggle switch (S1) instead.

3) Except for the SEGGER RTT block addresses, all readme information is common to both i3c_master and i3c_slave example projects.

4) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x200054a0
   b. Keil:	Not Available
   c. IAR:      Not Available

5) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

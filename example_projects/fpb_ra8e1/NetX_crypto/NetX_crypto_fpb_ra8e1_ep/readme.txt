1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of NetX secure crypto on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP
  	supporting SCE7/SCE9/RSIP-E51A Hardware acceleration using AzureRTOS. The example project executes AES, ECC, RSA 
	algorithms(including different chaining modes) in multi-threaded environment using mutex to enable access to SCE/RSIP. 
	The user can enter any key to enable concurrent execution of the different algorithms and status of the execution
	will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Software Requirements:
     	Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 5.7.0
     	e2 studio: Version 2024-10
     	SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.10f
     	LLVM Embedded Toolchain for ARM: Version 18.1.3

3. Hardware Requirements:
     	Supported RA Boards:
		SCE7      - EK-RA6M2
     		SCE9      - EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5
     		RSIP-E51A - EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, FPB-RA8E1
     	1 x Renesas RA board.
     	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
     	1 x A PC running Windows 10 with at least 1 USB port for debug.

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22060180
   b. Keil:     Not Available 
   c. IAR:      Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

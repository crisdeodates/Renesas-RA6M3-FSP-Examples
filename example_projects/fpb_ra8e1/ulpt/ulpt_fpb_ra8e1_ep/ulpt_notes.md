# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the functionality of ULPT in periodic mode and one-shot mode. The user selects the period for both one-shot and periodic timers as 1 second, 2 seconds, or 3 seconds. After selecting the period, the ULPT1 starts in periodic mode and toggles the on-board LED when the ULPT1 underflow interrupt occurs. The ULPT1 will stop after underflow three times, and the ULPT0 will start in one-shot mode after that. The MCU will be put into Deep SW Standby mode and wait for the ULPT0 underflow interrupt to reset the MCU internally to Normal Mode and restart the EP.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

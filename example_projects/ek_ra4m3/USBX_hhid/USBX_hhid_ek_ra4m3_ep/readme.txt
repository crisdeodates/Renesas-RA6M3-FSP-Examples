    Upon Connecting a keyboard and pressing a key, the received keycode is displayed on the Jlink RTTViewer. 
    Upon connecting a mouse, the x and y axis position will be printed on Jlink RTTViewer. The updated value of x and y axis 
    prints only when there is change in X and Y Position. Error and info messages will be printed on JlinkRTTViewer.

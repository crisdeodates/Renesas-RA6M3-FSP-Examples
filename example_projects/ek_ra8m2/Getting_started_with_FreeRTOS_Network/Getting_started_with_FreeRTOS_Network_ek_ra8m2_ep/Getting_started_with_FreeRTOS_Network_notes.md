# Introduction #
This example project demonstrates FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP's networking capabilities using the Ethernet interface of the RA MCU. It utilizes the FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP stack to perform various network operations, including sending and receiving data over TCP and UDP protocols. The RA board will automatically obtain an IP address from the network using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client service.

Once the RA board successfully acquires the IP address, users can interact with the system by selecting options from a menu, which is accessible via the RTT Viewer or a terminal application running on the host PC. After the RA board retrieves its IP address from the router, it will display the network configuration details, along with the available menu options, in the terminal application. This enables the user to explore different features and operations supported by the network stack.

Key functionalities in this example include:
* TCP Client Service: Establish a connection with the server, send a request, wait for the server's response, and disconnect upon completion.
* UDP Client Service: Send a message to a server and listen for the response.
* DNS Client Service: Perform a DNS query based on a domain name specified by the user.
* Web HTTP Server: Process HTTP requests from a browser, allowing users to access the homepage, view board network configurations, control onboard LEDs, and check their status.

Note:
* Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer. If supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
* To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please refer to the instructions provided in the Special Topic.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the FreeRTOS Network Example project, the following resources are needed.

### Software ###
* Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 6.2.0
* e2 studio: Version 2025-10
* SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.74
* LLVM Embedded Toolchain for ARM: Version 18.1.3
* Terminal Console Application: Tera Term or a similar application
* Socket Application: sokit version 1.3, etc.
* Browser Application: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, etc.

### Hardware ###
* Supported RA boards: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8P1, EK-RA8M2
* 1 x Ethernet router with an internet connection.
* 2 x Ethernet cables to connect the RA board and the host PC to the router.
* 1 x Type-C USB cable for programming, debugging, and status display on the terminal (Tera Term or SEGGER RTT J-Link Viewer).

### Hardware Connections ###
* Power on the Router: Ensure the router is powered on and properly connected to the internet. Verify that the routerâ€™s LAN ports 
	are active and available for connections.
* Connect the RA Board to the Router: Take an Ethernet cable and connect one end to the Ethernet port on the RA board, 
	and the other end to one of the router's available LAN ports. This connection allows the RA board to communicate with 
	the network and obtain an IP address via DHCP.
* Connect the Host PC to the Router: Using a second Ethernet cable, connect the host PC to another LAN port on the same router. 
	This step ensures that both the RA board and the host PC are on the same network, enabling communication between them 
	for debugging and menu operations.
* Connect the RA Board to the Host PC: Using a Type-C USB cable, connect the RA board to the host PC. This connection is necessary 
	for programming the RA board, enabling debugging, and displaying runtime information in the terminal or RTT Viewer on the host PC.
* By following these steps, you'll establish proper hardware connections between the RA board, the router, and the host PC, 
	ensuring smooth network communication and debugging capabilities.
* For EK-RA8D1: Set the configuration switches (SW1) as below.

  | SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
  |-------------|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
  | OFF | OFF | OFF | OFF | ON | OFF | OFF | OFF |

* For EK-RA8M1: Remove jumper J61 to enable Ethernet B.

* For EK-RA8M2: The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3, and J29 on pins 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 to use the on-board debug functionality.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import the example project.
2. Double click Configuration.xml file, and click Generate Project Content. Next, build the project (Keep the project path short to prevent errors during the build process).
3. Connect the RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.  
Note: Before performing test, please confirm that the host PC has enabled the inbound rule '**File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)**' for accept ping request from RA MCU to TCP server: **Windows Defender Firewall -> Advanced settings -> Inbound Rules -> Enable File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In).**  
![ping_enable.png](images/ping_enable.png "Enable Ping action")
4. Open a serial terminal application on the host PC (Tera Term) and connect to the COM Port provided by the J-Link onboard or Open J-link RTT Viewer (In case the user selected SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer).
    * Note: For using the serial terminal:
      * Please ensure that the connection to the RTT viewer has been terminated if it was previously established.
      * Please ensure that 'Local echo' is checked to echo back characters typed in serial terminal.
      * The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.
5. Debug or flash the EP to the RA board.
6. After the main menu is displayed on the terminal application (Tera Term), the user can select options to perform EP operations.
    * Initialize Ethernet IP and obtain a dynamic IP address if DHCP is enabled.

## Special Topic ##

Special notes:
* Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer; if supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
  * To configure display options:
    * **For UART via J-Link OB VCOM**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1`
    * **For J-Link RTT Viewer**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0`
  * The board supports J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8P1, EK-RA8M2.
    
  Set this in **Project Properties** -> **C/C++ Build** -> **Settings** -> **Tool Settings** -> **Compiler** -> **Includes** -> **Macro Defines (-D)**.

* The HTTP server retrieves web resources from the `web.bin` file located at `Getting_started_with_FreeRTOS_Network_ek_ra8d1_ep/e2studio/src/web.bin`. This file is a FAT12-formatted binary image that encapsulates web assets such as HTML and images. To create `web.bin` in a Linux environment, such as Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), follow these steps:
  1. **Create an empty binary file (`web.bin`)**  
     ```bash
     dd if=/dev/zero of=web.bin bs=4096 count=32
     ```

  2. **Format the binary file as a FAT12 filesystem**  
     ```bash
     mkdosfs -F 12 -S 4096 -s 1 web.bin
     ```

  3. **Mount the FAT12 filesystem**  
     ```bash
     mkdir -p /mnt/web_bin
     sudo mount -o loop web.bin /mnt/web_bin
     ```

  4. **Copy resources into the filesystem**  
     ```bash
     sudo cp -r /path/to/web/resources/* /mnt/web_bin/
     ```

  5. **Unmount the filesystem**  
     ```bash
     sudo umount /mnt/web_bin
     ```

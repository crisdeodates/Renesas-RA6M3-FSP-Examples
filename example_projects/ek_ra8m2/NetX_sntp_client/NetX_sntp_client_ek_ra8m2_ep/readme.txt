1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the NetX Duo SNTP Client using the Ethernet driver on
	Renesas RA MCUs with the Renesas FSP NetX Duo stack and Azure RTOS. The example project uses the MCU internal
	RTC for system time and the DHCP client to obtain an IP address from the DHCP server. Upon successfully
	receiving an IP address from the DHCP server, the success status and the client IP address are displayed in
	the J-Link RTT Viewer. The SNTP Client is created, and the SNTP server IP address is resolved through DNS stack
	functions using the provided server URL. The SNTP client then requests the server to provide network timestamp
	updates. Upon successfully receiving a timestamp from the server, the MCU internal RTC timestamp is read and
	compared with the received timestamp. The RTC time is updated if there is any difference. Error and information
	messages are printed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA8M2
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	1 x Ethernet/LAN cable (Ethernet cable CAT5/6).
	1 x Ethernet switch.

3. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1:
		Connect the RA board USB device port to the host machine via a micro USB cable.
		Connect LAN cable on RA board at ethernet port and other end connect to Ethernet switch/router.

	For MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA8M2:
		Connect the RA board USB device port to the host machine via a Type-C USB cable.
		Connect LAN cable on RA board at ethernet port and other end connect to Ethernet switch/router.

4. Hardware Configuration:
	For EK-RA8D1:
		The user must set the configuration switches (SW1) as below to avoid potential failures:
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		| SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		|     OFF     |     OFF     |      OFF     |     OFF    |     ON     |     OFF    |     OFF     |     OFF   |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+

		CAUTION: Do not enable SW1-4 and SW1-5 together.

	For EK-RA8M1:
		The user must remove jumper J61 to enable Ethernet B.

	For EK-RA8M2:
		The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3, and J29 on pins 1-2,
		3-4, 5-6, 7-8 to use the on-board debug functionality.

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio:	0x22000570
   b. Keil:	Not Available
   c. IAR:	Not Available

2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

3) On RA MCUs with TrustZone, IDAU boundaries are programmed by this project due to the use of Ethernet and EDMAC
   peripherals. Consequentially, it is necessary to connect the serial programming interface to meet this requirement.

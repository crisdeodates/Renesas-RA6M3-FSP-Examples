# Introduction #
This Project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USBX Peripheral Audio device driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. The RA MCU will be connected as USBX peripheral audio to the Host PC. An audio wave file will be played on the Host PC using an audio player (Audacity). The wave audio data will be transferred from Host PC to the MCU using the isochronous OUT, through USBX PAUD module. Once the audio data is received on the MCU, the received audio data will be stored on the MCU SRAM. When Host PC starts recording the audio using the audio recorder (Audacity), MCU will send the audio data stored in the MCU SRAM to the Host PC using the isochronous IN, through USBX PAUD module. The user will be able to play, listen and verify the recorded audio file data. The application status messages will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

## Verifying Operation ##
* Import the EP and perform the following update if USB speed configuration is changed, in addition to the updates described in the section “Module Configuration Notes”.

  **For High Speed USB on EK-RA6M5, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8P1, EK-RA8M2:**
  
    * Uncomment the macro APL_AUDIO_20 in usbx_paud_ep.h
	
  **For Full Speed USB on EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1, MCK-RA8T2, EK-RA8M2:**
  
    * Comment the macro APL_AUDIO_20 in usbx_paud_ep.h  

  **Note:** High Speed USB is enabled by default in the project configuration for MCUs that support High-Speed operation. For MCUs that only support Full Speed USB, the default configuration is set accordingly. 

* Build and debug the EP (see section Starting Development of FSP User Manual). After running the EP, open J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output status of the EP.
* Open any audio record and playback application on the host (for example **Audacity**).
* Select the MIC and Speaker from the PC application to use the enumerated Audio Peripheral Device “**Headset Earphone (USB Audio Demonstration)**” and “**Microphone (USB Audio Demonstration)**”.

 ![usb_paud](images/Audio_IO_Settings.jpg "Audio IO Settings")

* Click **File > Open** and select the audio sample file.
* Play the selected audio sample from the host.
* Create a new instance by clicking **File > New**.
* Select the MIC and Speaker from the PC application to use the enumerated Audio Peripheral Device “**Headset Earphone (USB Audio Demonstration)** ” and “**Microphone (USB Audio Demonstration)** ”.

 ![usb_paud](images/Audio_IO_Settings.jpg "Audio IO Settings")

* Start recording Audio from instance created above.
* Stop the recording.
* Save the recording by clicking **File > Export Audio... > Export to computer > name the audio file > Export**.

 ![usb_paud](images/Save_Options.jpg "Settings to save Audio file")

* Verify the playback and recorded sample are similar.
* Disconnect the kit and play the exported file to hear the recorded audio.

## Special Topics ##
### Developing Descriptor ###
A USB device provides information about itself in data structures called USB descriptors. 	

The host obtains descriptors from an attached device by sending various standard control requests to the default endpoint. Those requests specify the type of descriptor to retrieve. In response to such requests, the device sends descriptors that include information about the device, its configurations, interfaces and the related endpoints.

* Refer **Descriptor** section in [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take the template file (**rm_usbx_pcdc_descriptor.c.template**) of the required USB combination from **ra/fsp/src/rm_usbx_port** folder and use the same in the source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

### User Callback Handlers ###
1. **apl_status_change_cb()** which handles the USB Attach and Remove events.
2. **apl_audio_instance_activate()** and **apl_audio_instance_deactivate()**, which handle the device stack enumeration events.

### Limitations of USBX PAUD Example Project ###
1. The Audio stored in the RAM is limited by the available RAM size of the MCU.
2. This EP establishes a physical audio device channel. Playback based on audio format is not handled on the MCU. Verification of data transmission is done on the PC.

# Introduction #
The example project shows the operation of the FileX file system on block media via the SDHI driver on the RA MCU. The FileX file system with exFAT format enabled, the project will perform various file system operations based on the user's selection from the menu options, such as media management (open, get property, format, close), directory management (create, get property, delete), and file management (create, write, read, delete). The J-Link RTT Viewer is used as the user interface. Menu options and system messages (errors and information messages) will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer during the execution of the project.    

In Main menu, based on RTT input, the user selects sub menu such as media menu, directory menu, or file menu.
1. Media operation menu.
2. Directory operation menu.
3. File operation menu.

In Media menu, based on RTT input, the user selects operations to perform.
1. Open Media.
2. Get Media Property.
3. Format Media.
4. Close Media.
5. Go back to main menu.

In Directory menu, based on RTT input, the user selects operations to perform.
1. Create Directory.
2. Get Directory property.
3. Delete Directory.
4. Go back to main menu.

In file menu, based on RTT input, the user selects operations to perform.
1. Create Empty File.
2. Write To File.
3. Read From File.
3. Delete File.
4. Go back to main menu.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import, generate, build the example project.
2. Connect the RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.
3. Connect the Pmod SD to the RA board: Using short wiring connections (Should be shorter than 10cm).
4. Insert the SD card into the Pmod SD.
5. Debug or flash the example project to the RA board.
6. Open the J-Link RTT Viewer.
7. After the main menu is displayed on the RTT Viewer, the user can select options to perform file system operations as needed. Note that the media must be opened before performing any other operations.

### Important Notes ###
1. SD/MicroSD card must be in exFAT format before verifying the EP.
2. In case the SD/MicroSD card is not in exFAT format, the user can format the SD/MicroSD card in exFAT format using this EP using the following procedure: Open Media -> Format Media -> Close Media -> Open Media.
3. The Media must be opened before performing any other operations.

### Menu details ###

    * Type '1' and enter to go to MEDIA MENU.
    * Type '2' and enter to go to DIRECTORY MENU.
    * Type '3' and enter to go to FILE MENU.
2. In MEDIA MENU: The user input options will perform media operations as follows:
    * Type '1' and enter to open the media.
    * Type '2' and enter to get media properties.
    * Type '3' and enter to format the media in exFAT format.
    * Type '4' and enter to close the media.
    * Type '5' and enter to go back MAIN MENU.
3. In DIRECTORY MENU: The user input options will perform directory operations as follows:
    * Type '1' and enter to create a new directory.
    * Type '2' and enter to get root directory properties.
    * Type '3' and enter to delete a directory.
    * Type '4' and enter to go back MAIN MENU.
4. In FILE MENU: The user input options will perform file operations as follows:
    * Type '1' and enter to create an empty file.
    * Type '2' and enter to write more than 4 GB of fixed content into a file.
    * Type '3' and enter to read the first 1 KB of content in a file.

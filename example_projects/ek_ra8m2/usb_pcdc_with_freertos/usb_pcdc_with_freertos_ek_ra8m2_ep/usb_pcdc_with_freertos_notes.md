# Introduction #
This example project demonstrates the basic functionality of USB PCDC driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. In this example, the user will be able to use the RA board as a CDC to UART converter by connecting through a COM port from the host PC. The converter performs the data reception and data transmission asynchronously. The user can connect any UART device to receive the data typed in Tera Term, and to send any data to the converter to display on Tera Term. The user can also change the baud rate, stop bit and parity bit configuration at run time through Tera Term. The status of the application will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

### Special Topics 
**Developing Descriptor**

A USB device provides information about itself in data structures called USB descriptors. 	

The host obtains descriptors from an attached device by sending various standard control requests to the default endpoint.
Those requests specify the type of descriptor to retrieve. In response to such requests, the device sends descriptors
that include information about the device, its configurations, interfaces and the related endpoints.
* Refer **Descriptor** section in FSP User manual (https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b___p_c_d_c.html) for developing the descriptor.

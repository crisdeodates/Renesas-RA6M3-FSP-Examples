1. Project Overview:
     This Example Project demonstrates the basic usage of SCI_SPI driver.
     The project writes commands to the temperature module MAX31723PMB1 and reads the temperature value using SCI_SPI bus which is configured as master, 
     The temperature values are continuously printed on JLink RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware settings for the project:


        Hardware connections:

        EK_RA2A1:     
        Connect Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PMODB(J6:1)
 
        EK_RA4M1/ EK_RA6M1/ EK_RA6M2 :
        Connect Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PMODA(J5:1)
        
        EK_RA6M3/ EK_RA6M3G/EK_RA2L1:
        Connect Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PMOD1(J26:1)	

        EK_RA4M3, EK_RA4M2,EK_RA6M4,EK_RA6M5,EK_RA2E1 and EK_RA2E2:
        Connect Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PMOD2(J25:1)

	RSSK_RA6T1/FPB-RA6E1/FPB-RA4E1:
	Temperature sensor(J1:4) to P102
	Temperature sensor(J1:2) to P101
	Temperature sensor(J1:3) to P100
	Temperature sensor(J1:5) to GND
	Temperature sensor(J1:6) to Vcc
	Temperature sensor(J1:1) to P103

        EK_RA4W1:
        Connect Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PMOD(CN6:1)

        MCK_RA6T2:
        Temperature sensor(J1:1) to PA12
	Temperature sensor(J1:2) to PA09
	Temperature sensor(J1:3) to PA10
	Temperature sensor(J1:4) to PA08
	Temperature sensor(J1:5) to GND
	Temperature sensor(J1:6) to Vcc

        Temperature sensor used: MAX31723

1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x20000ca4
   b. Keil: Not Available 
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

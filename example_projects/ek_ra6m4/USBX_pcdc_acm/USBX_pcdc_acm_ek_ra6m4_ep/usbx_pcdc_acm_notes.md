# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Device CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. In this example project, user will use the RA board as a CDC device which will enumerate as a COM port when connected to the host PC. Once the COM port is enabled, user can provide input from the Serial terminal. User input will be echoed on the serial terminal. The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer.

## Verifying operation ##

Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of FSP User Manual). After running the EP, open RTT viewer to see the output status of ep.
Open any serial terminal (preferably Tera Term) for providing user input to view the echoed data.

**Note:** To view echoed data, **local echo** in serial terminal should be enabled.

1. Below images showcases the output on **JLinkRTT_Viewer** :


 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/rtt_log.jpg "RTT output")

2. Below image showcases the sample output on **Serial Terminal** :


 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/serial_terminal.jpg "Serial Terminal output")
 
3. Below image showcases the device enumeration in device manager. User can update the Vendor ID and Product ID of their own devices in descriptor file.

 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/usbx_pcdc_pid_vid_snapshot.jpg "Device Manager")

### Special Topics 
#### Developing Descriptor
1. Refer **Descriptor** section in [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take template file of required usb combination from mentioned path in above link and use the same in source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

#### User Callback Handlers
1. **usbx_status_callback()** which handles the USB Attach and Removed events.
2. **ux_cdc_device0_instance_activate()** and **ux_cdc_device0_instance_deactivate()** which handles the device stack enumeration events.


#### USBX_PCDC Example Project Limitations

1. Limitation in **ZLP**. When the data transfer is an exact multiple of MaxPacketSize (requested_length), **ZLP handler** should be added after the USB Write call to indicate end of transfer.

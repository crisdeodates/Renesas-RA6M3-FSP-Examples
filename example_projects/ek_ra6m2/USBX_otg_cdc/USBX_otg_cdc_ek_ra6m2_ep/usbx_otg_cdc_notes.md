# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USBX OTG CDC driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS.
Two RA MCU boards(Device-A and Device-B) will be connected to back to back using USB OTG Board(EB-USB-OTG) and its associated OTG cable.
Initially Device-A will act as a CDC host device and Device-B will act as a CDC peripheral device. The host (Device-A) will send data to 
the peripheral(Device-B) and peripheral(Device-B) will echo the data back to host(Device-A). Upon pressing (PUSH BTN)SW1 on Peripheral(Device-B),
the EP will switch the roles of the two devices, i.e. host acting as peripheral and peripheral as host. After switching roles, the new host 
device(Device-B) will send data to the new peripheral device(Device-A) and the peripheral device(Device-A) will echo the data back to host(Device-B).
USBX status and any errors will be printed on the JLinkRTTViewer which will be handled in a separate thread. 

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

### Special Topics 
#### Developing Descriptor

A USB device provides information about itself in data structures called USB descriptors. 	

The host obtains descriptors from an attached device by sending various standard control requests to the default endpoint. Those requests specify the type of descriptor to retrieve. In response to such requests, the device sends descriptors that include information about the device, its configurations, interfaces and the related endpoints.

* Refer **Descriptor** section in [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take the template file (**rm_usbx_otg_descriptor.c.template**) of the required USB combination from **ra/fsp/src/rm_usbx_port** folder and use the same in the source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

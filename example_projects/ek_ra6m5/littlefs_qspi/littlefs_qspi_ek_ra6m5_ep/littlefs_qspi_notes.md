# Introduction #

This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of LittleFS for external flash (e.g., SPI, OSPI, QSPI) on RA MCU based on FSP. The project will perform various file system operations based on the user's selection from menu options, such as erase entire flash, erase 32 KB flash, format file system, directory management (create, get properties, delete),and file management (create, write, read, delete). The terminal application is used as the user interface. The menu options and system messages (errors and information messages) will be printed on the terminal application during the execution of the project.

In the Main Menu, the user selects a sub menu such as Flash Operations Menu, Directory Operations Menu, File Operations Menu.
1. Flash Operations.
2. Directory Operations.
3. File Operations.

In the Flash Operations Menu, the user selects operation to perform.
1. Erase the entire Flash.
2. Erase the first 32 KB of the Flash.
3. Format the File System.
4. Go back to the Main Menu.

In the Directory Operations Menu, the user selects operation to perform.
1. Create the Directory.
2. Get the Directory Properties.
3. Delete the Directory.
4. Go back to the Main Menu.

In the File Operations Menu, the user selects operation to perform.
1. Open the File.
2. Write to the File.
3. Read from the File.
4. Delete the File.
5. Go back to the Main Menu.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage | Searchable Keyword  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| LittleFS | LittleFS is used for file system operation. | LittleFS |
| LittleFS on SPI Flash | This module provides the hardware port layer for the LittleFS file system on SPI flash memory. | rm_littlefs_spi_flash |
| QSPI Flash | QSPI is used to configure flash device and perform write, read, or erase operations on flash device's memory array. | r_qspi |

**Note:**
* Blocking Read/Write/Erase:  
  The LittleFS port blocks on Read/Write/Erase calls until the operation has completed.
* Memory Constraints:  
  The block size defined in the LittleFS configuration must be a multiple of the data flash erase size of the MCU. It must be greater than 104 bytes which is the minimum block size of a LittleFS block.

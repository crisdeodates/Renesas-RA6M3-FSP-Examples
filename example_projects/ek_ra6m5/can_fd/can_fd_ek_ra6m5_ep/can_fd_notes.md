# Introduction #

This example project showcases CAN FD communication using two Renesas RA boards. Users can configure the nominal baud rate, data baud rate, and sample point at runtime, and initiate data transmission with the selected settings. To stop the transmission and return to the baud rate configuration menu, users simply press the Enter key without entering any input.

During transmission, data is sent from Board1 to Board2. Upon receiving the data, Board2 displays it on the terminal and sends an updated message back to Board1. When Board1 receives this data, it converts the CAN frame to a CAN FD frame and transmits it back to Board2. Board2, upon receiving this frame, further updates the data and sends it to Board1 using the CAN FD format.

Finally, once the transmission cycle completes, Board1 prints the received data on the terminal.

**Note**: In this example project, the same code runs on both boards. The board from which the user initiates the transmission becomes board1, and the board which receives the data becomes board2.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the CAN FD example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware Requirements ###
* Supported RA boards: EK-RA6M5
* 2 x RA boards
* 2 x Micro USB cables  
* For using on board CAN Transceivers: 3 x Jumper wires with both ends female
* For using external CAN-FD Transceiver Board (eg.OM13099): 
    * 1 x OM13099 (CAN-FD Transceiver Board): 
        * Link product: [OM13099 (CAN-FD Transceiver Board)](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/can-transceivers/can-with-flexible-data-rate/dual-can-fd-transceiver-shield:OM13099).
        * Manufacturer Product Number: OM13099
    * 9 x Jumper wires with both ends female

### Hardware Connections  ###
Note: This project requires two RA boards, which may be the same MCUs (e.g., EK-RA8M1 <-> EK-RA8M1) or different MCUs (e.g., EK-RA8M1 <-> EK-RA6T3).

Identical boards with onboard CAN transceivers populated: simply connect CANH, CANL, and GND between the two boards.

Identical boards without populated transceivers (e.g., EK-RA8D1 <-> EK-RA8D1) or different board types lacking onboard transceivers (e.g., EK-RA8D1 <-> EK-RA6T3): use an external OM13099 board and wire it as detailed in the optional sections for each board combination.

* EK-RA6M5:
    * For using on board CAN Transceivers:
        - Short E33, E34 & E35 
        - J33:1 of board 1 to J33:1 of board 2
        - J33:2 of board 1 to J33:2 of board 2
        - J33:3 of board 1 to J33:3 of board 2

    * (Optional) For using external CAN-FD Transceiver Board:
    	- Note: To use the external CAN-FD transceiver, the user must either cut E33, E34, and E35 to prevent conflicts with the onboard CAN transceiver or configure alternative CAN CTX and CRX pins instead of cutting E33, E34, and E35.

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

**Note**: Following is the formula for data and nominal rate calculation.

**baud rate = canfd_clock_hz / ((time_segment_1 + time_segment_2 + 1) * prescalar)**

Refer [FSP User Manual on GitHub](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___c_a_n_f_d.html) for more details like min, max values of time_segment_1, time_segment_2 and prescalar.

These values are chosen by taking reference of ek-ra6m5 hardware user manual from the **Section 32.4.1**

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import the example project. 
2. Generate, and build the example project.
3. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are completed.
4. Connect the RA Board debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable.
5. Open J-Link RTT Viewer and connect to the RA board.
6. Debug or flash the example project to the RA board to view output log.

Note: Since the same project applies to both boards, repeat these steps on Board 2 as well.

Below images showcases the output on J-Link RTT Viewer :

## Special Topics ##
1. Ensure the configured baud rate of 2 Boards are same.
3. The user is expected to enter data not exceeding 15 bytes in size.
4. For OM13099 (CAN Transceiver Board):
	* Connect P3 loopback connection on CAN Transceiver Board with jumper cables instead of a db9 serial cable.
	* Connect jumpers J3, J4, J5 and J6 on OM13099 (CAN Transceiver Board) to establish connection to CAN termination resistors.

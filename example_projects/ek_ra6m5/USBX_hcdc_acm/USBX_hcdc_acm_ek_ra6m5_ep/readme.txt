1. Project Overview:
     This Example Project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Host CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs
     using 2 RA boards. Board 1 acts as Host device running USBX HCDC-ACM example project and Board 2 acts as Peripheral device
     running USBX PCDC-ACM example project and connected with micro USB cable via OTG. The peripheral initiates the communication 
     and once the host reads the data initiated by the peripheral. The host will then send predefined data to the peripheral and the
     device will echo the data back to the host. The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer. 

2. Supported Boards:
    EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA6M5

3. Hardware Requirements:
    External Hardware : OTG cable: Micro to USB Host (Female)   - 1 nos
                        USB A to USB Micro B Cable              - 3 nos

	For MCK-RA8T1:  OTG cable: Type C to USB Host (Female)  - 1 nos
                        USB A to USB Type C Cable               - 3 nos

	EK-RA6M5 - Running USBX HCDC Example Project. 
	Any RA board running USBX PCDC Example Project.

4. Configuration changes to switch Speed in configurator: 

     i. Full-Speed: (EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA6M5)
          USB Speed                      :    Full Speed
          USB Module Number              :    USB_IP0 Port
          DMA Source Address             :    FS Address
          DMA Destination Address        :    FS Address
          DMAC Transfer Size             :    2 Bytes

    ii. High-Speed: (EK-RA6M3)
          USB Speed                      :    Hi Speed
          USB Module Number              :    USB_IP1 Port
          DMA Source Address             :    HS Address
          DMA Destination Address        :    HS Address
          DMAC Transfer Size             :    4 Bytes

5. Hardware Connections:
	Connect Board 1, running USBX HCDC ACM Example Project, through OTG cable to Board 2, running USBX PCDC ACM Example Project.

   Jumper Settings: 

     i. Full-Speed: (EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA6M5)
          Jumper J12 placement is pins 1-2
          Remove Jumper J15 pins
          Connect USB device to J11 connector with help of micro USB Host cable.

    ii. High-Speed:(EK-RA6M3)
          Jumper J7: Connect pins 1-2
          Remove Jumper J17 pins
          Connect USB device to J6 connector with help of micro USB Host cable.

   iii. Full-Speed: (MCK-RA8T1)
          Jumper JP9 placement is pins 1-2
          Remove Jumper J10 pins
          Connect USB device to CN14 connector with help of micro USB Host cable.

6. Steps for Running the EP
   1. Import, generate and build the USBX PCDC and USBX HCDC EP.
   2. Now, flash USBX PCDC code on RA board(i.e board 2) which will acts as peripheral device.
   3. Open RTT viewer for Board 2.
   4. Next, flash USBX HCDC code on another RA Board (i.e board 1) which will acts as host device.
   5. Open RTT viewer for Board 1 and verify host device operation.

Note: 
1) Both USBX HCDC and PCDC board needs to be running at High Speed or Full Speed in order for the correct EP functionality.

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x20000a04
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR:  	Not Available

3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of SCI Smart Card Interface Device on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas
	FSP using SCI_SMCI module without RTOS. ISO 7816-3 Smart Card will be connected to the RA board which is configured as
	SCI Smart Card Interface (Please looks at the Table of Smart Card Connections). The application sets and configure baud 
	rate for the smart. This project also demonstrates the ATR proceeds in five steps: Initial character TS; format bytes T0;
	Interface bytes TAi, TBi, TCi, TDi and vaiable number; Historical bytes, and the check byte TCK (optional) for SIM Card 
	and Debit Card.	For the SIM Card, the application proceeds the activation process including Answer To Reset stage and 
	negotiation stage will show(Completed PPS exchange). For the Debit Card, user can follow the the Menu to do the test. User
	can "Enter" value from Menu and all information of the chip in the card the Smart Card connected to the RA board will be 
	printed it the RTTViewer...

The following is the procedure to operation this EP using sci_smci module:

1. Connect SIM Card or Debit Card to the board as mentioned in readme file.

2. Connect RA MCU board to the PC as mentioned in readme file.

3. Generate, build, and download the sci_smic_ek_ra6m5 example project to the RA board.

4. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the Output status.

    Below image show the Output Information of the SIM Card after ATR responsed and displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:

    Below images show the Output Information of the Debit Card after ATR responsed and displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:
	
	![Debit_card_output](Images/Debit_Card_Output_to_RTTviewer.jpg "ATR Info of Debit Card")
	
	Follow the instructions displayed on the RTT Viewer as shown above.
	
	a. Enter “1” to issue a SELECT MF command based on APDU case-3 format.

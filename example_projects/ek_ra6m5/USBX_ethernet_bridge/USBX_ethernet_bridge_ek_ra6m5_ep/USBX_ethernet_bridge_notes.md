# Introduction #

This example project demonstrates the use of the Azure NetX Duo network stack over the USBX RNDIS module on an RA MCU. It performs various network operations leveraging NetX Duo. The RA board creates a DHCP server and assigns the dynamic IP address for the host PC. The RA board and the host PC are directly linked via a point-to-point Ethernet connection over a USB cable. After obtaining the IP address, the project enables the user to interact with a menu through the J-Link RTT Viewer or a terminal application on the host PC.

The available operations include:
* TCP Client Service: Connect to a server, send a request, wait for a response from the server, and disconnect from the server.
* UDP Client Service: Send a request and wait for a response from the server.
* Web HTTP Server: Handle HTTP requests from the browser, including requesting the homepage, retrieving board network configuration, controlling onboard LEDs, and requesting the status of onboard LEDs.

The menu options:
* Type `1 <x.x.x.x>:<port>` to perform TCP client operation.
* Type `2 <x.x.x.x>:<port>` to perform UDP client operation.
* Type `3` to start the web HTTP server.

Notes: 
* For RA boards that do not support J-Link OB VCOM,  EP information is communicated to the user via host PC exclusively through the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer.
    * The board does not support J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA6M5.
* For the RA boards support J-Link OB VCOM, the EP uses the Serial Terminal by default instead.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ## 
To build and run the example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware Requirements ###
* Supported RA boards: EK-RA6M5
* 1 x RA Board.
* 2 x Micro USB cables.
    * One cable is used for firmware programming and debugging via the onboard debugger.

### Hardware Connections  ###
* General: Connect the RA Board to the Host PC: Using a micro-USB cable, connect the RA board's [DEBUG] port to the host PC. This connection is necessary
  for programming the RA board, enabling debugging, and displaying runtime information in the terminal or RTT Viewer on the host PC.
* For the specific RA boards, to establish network connectivity, connect any 1 port (High speed or Full Speed) of the RA board's USB Port to the Host PC following the below introductions:
    * EK-RA6M5:
        * High Speed (Default):
            * Connect the RA board's USB HS port (J31 connector) to the Host PC using a micro USB cable.
            * Connect the jumper J17 pins.
            * Short Pin 2-3 of jumper J7.
        * Full Speed:
            * Connect the RA board's USB FS port (J11 connector) to the Host PC using a micro USB cable.
            * Connect the jumper J15 pins.
            * Short Pin 2-3 of jumper J12.

### Software Requirements ###
* Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 6.1.0
* e2 studio: Version 2025-07
* GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.2.1.arm-13-7

## Special Topics ##
### 1. Additional include path: ###
"The required include paths for the manually added drivers have already been configured to ensure successful compilation. 

The following paths were added to the **Project Properties** -> **C/C++ Build** -> **Settings** -> **Tool Settings** -> **GNU ARM Cross C Compiler** -> **Includes** -> **Include paths (-I)**:

1. ` "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/src/ux_network_driver_src}" `
2. ` "${workspace_loc:/${ProjName}/src/ux_device_class_rndis_src}" `

### 2. Terminal notes: ###
* Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer; if supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
  * To configure display options:
    * **For UART via J-Link OB VCOM**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1`
    * **For J-Link RTT Viewer**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0`
  * The board does not support J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA6M5.

Set this in **Project Properties** -> **C/C++ Build** -> **Settings** -> **Tool Settings** -> **GNU ARM Cross C Compiler** -> **Preprocessor**.

![USE_VIRTUAL_COM settings](images/use_virtual_com_setting.png "USE_VIRTUAL_COM settings")

### 3. Webserver folder notes: ###
* The `src/webserver` folder contains all the necessary files for the web HTTP server functionality.
* The `src/webserver/website` folder contains all the resources that will be served by the web server.
    * The `index.html` file is the main HTML file for the homepage of the website.
    * The `script.js` file includes all the JavaScript functions used to create dynamic content on the website.
    * The `logo.png` file is the logo displayed on the homepage.
    * The `favicon.ico` file is the small icon that appears in the browser tab for the website.
* The `src/webserver/website.bin` is a file system image containing all the files from the `website` folder in FAT12 format. This image is loaded into the external OSPI flash on the RA board to support FileX operations, which serve as a file system dependency for the web HTTP server.

### 4. Software Introduction ###

7. After the system boot into windows, connect the RA board to Host PC like the [hardware connection](#hardware-connections) section 

8. Open Device Manager, you will find out that there is an unknown USB device under "Other devices" category. Right-click this unknown USB device and select "Update driver" option

![Step 8](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step8.png "Update driver")

9. Select "Browse my computer for drivers"

![Step 9](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step9.png "Select Browse my computer for drivers")

10. Select "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer"

![Step 10](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step10.png "Select the RNDIS drivers")

11. Click "Next" button

![Step 11](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step11.png "Click Next button")

12. Click "Have Disk..." button

![Step 12](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step12.png "Click Have Disk... button")

13. Browse the directory where you store the unsigned RNDIS INF file. This file is stored in the e2studio folder with name is **RNDIS_INF_NDIS_6_0_for_RA.inf**

![Step 13](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step13.png "Select the RNDIS INF file path")

14. During the driver installation, you may receive a pop-up message to notify below information. This is due to the use of unsigned INF. Click install this driver software anyway

![Step 14](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step14.png "Click install this driver software anyway")

15. Once the driver installation is completed. you should be able to see message as same as below

![Step 15](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step15.png "Successful notification")

16. Now, In Device Manager, if you see the Remote NDIS6 based Device under "Network adapters" category, the RNDIS driver is installed successfully.

![Step 16](images/install_RNDIS_driver/step16.png "The RA USB device is recognized as Remote NDIS6 based Device")

Note: The file **RNDIS_INF_NDIS_6_0_for_RA.inf** is based on the [Window RNDIS template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/remote-ndis-inf-template). In this file, the VID and PID have been modified to match the USB descriptor used in this project.

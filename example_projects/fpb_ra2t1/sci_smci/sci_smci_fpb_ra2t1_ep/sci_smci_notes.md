# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of the SCI Smart Card Interface Device on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using SCI_SMCI module without RTOS. An ISO 7816-3 Smart Card is connected to the RA board, which is configured as SCI Smart Card Interface (please refer to the Table of Smart Card Connections). The application sets and configures baud rate for the smart card. This project also demonstrates the ATR proceeds in five steps: Initial character TS; Format bytes T0; Interface bytes TAi, TBi, TCi, TDi and variable number; Historical bytes, and the check byte TCK (optional) for SIM Card and Debit Card.

For the SIM Card, the application proceeds with the activation process including Answer To Reset (ATR) stage and negotiation stage will show (completed PPS exchange).

For the Debit Card, the user can follow the menu to do the test. The user can "Enter" value from Menu, and all information of the chip in the Smart Card connected to the RA board will be printed in the RTT Viewer.

1) Pins for Pin I/O must be tied together, pulled up to VCC via a resistor from 1k to 4.7k Ohms (using 1k Ohms for EK-RA2L2), and connected to the DATA line of the connected card.

2) If a Smart Card Socket is unavailable: Pin 5 (DETECT) of the card does not need to connect to the MCU's DETECT Pin. However, the MCU's Detect Pin must be pulled high to 3.3V (high = Smart Card inserted).

## Verifying operation ##
Import the EP and perform necessary changes in the project configuration. Please see the Module Configuration Notes section for more details.

The following is the procedure to operation this EP using sci_smci module:
1. Connect SIM Card or Debit Card to the board as mentioned in readme file.
2. Connect RA MCU board to the PC as mentioned in readme file.
3. Generate, build, and download the EP to the RA board.
4. Open the J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the Output status.

    The image below shows the output information of the SIM card after the ATR has responded and has been displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:  
	![Sim_card_output](images/Sim_Card_Output_to_RTTviewer.jpg "ATR Info of SIM Card")
	
    The image below shows the output information of the Debit card after the ATR has responded and has been displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:  
	![Debit_card_output](images/Debit_Card_Output_to_RTTviewer.jpg "ATR Info of Debit Card")
	
	Follow the instructions displayed on the RTT Viewer as shown above.  
	a. Enter '1' to issue a SELECT MF command based on the APDU Case 3 format.  
	![Debit_card_output](images/Debit_Card_Select_1_Output_to_RTTviewer.jpg "SELECT MF command based on APDU case 3 format")
	
	b. Enter '2' to issue a GET CHALLENGE command based on the APDU Case 2 format.  
	![Debit_card_output](images/Debit_Card_Select_2_Output_to_RTTviewer.jpg "GET CHALLENGE command based on APDU case 2 format")
	
	c. **Note:** If a Smart Card Socket is unavailable, the user must reconnect the MCU's DETECT pin from 3.3V to GND (low = Smart Card removed). Then enter '3' to perform smart card device de-activation.  

	Below image show the Output Information of the smart card device de-activation and displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:  
	![Debit_card_output](images/Debit_Card_Select_3_Output_to_RTTviewer_1.jpg "Performs smart card device de-activation")
	
	d. **Note:** If a Smart Card Socket is unavailable, the user must reconnect the MCU's DETECT pin from GND to 3.3V (high = Smart Card inserted), so the MCU will detect smart card.  

	Below image show the Output Information of the smart card device after reinserted and displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer:

# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the basic functionality of USB PCDC driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. In this example,
user will be able to use the RA board as a CDC to UART converter by connecting through a COM port from from the host PC.
The converter performs the data reception and data transmission asynchronously. The user can connect any UART device to receive the data typed in Tera Term,
and to send any data to the converter to display on Tera Term. The user can also change the baud rate, stop bit and parity bit configuration at run time
through Tera Term. The status of the application will be displayed on JLink RTT Viewer.

## Verifying operation ##
* Import, Build and Debug the EP(see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**).
* Connect USB cables, connecting wires as mentioned in the readme file [readme.txt](./readme.txt)
* Run the EP and then open JLink RTT Viewer to see the output status of the EP.
* Open any serial terminal (preferably Tera Term) on the HOST PC and connect to COM port as shown below:
	![com_port](images/com_port.jpg "COM_PORT")
* Configure baud rate, stop bit and parity bit settings on the serial terminal(Tera Term) based on the settings of the external UART device connected to converter.
  Note that only CTS/RTS flow control is tested with TeraTerm.
  
	![serial_port_settings](images/serial_port.jpg "SERIAL_PORT_SETTINGS")
* Enable "local echo" in the serial terminal if you would like to view the data sent by the serial terminal.
* Send data using serial terminal(Tera term) to external UART device.
* View the data received from the external UART device via the converter through the serial terminal (Tera Term).
* The status messages will be displayed in Jlink RTTViewer as depicted below:

	![rtt_log_1](images/rtt_1.jpg "RTT_LOG 1")
	
	![rtt_log_2](images/rtt_2.jpg "RTT_LOG 2")

### Special Topics 
**Developing Descriptor**

A USB device provides information about itself in data structures called USB descriptors. 	

The host obtains descriptors from an attached device by sending various standard control requests to the default endpoint.
Those requests specify the type of descriptor to retrieve. In response to such requests, the device sends descriptors
that include information about the device, its configurations, interfaces and the related endpoints.
* Refer **Descriptor** section in FSP User manual (https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b___p_c_d_c.html) for developing the descriptor.

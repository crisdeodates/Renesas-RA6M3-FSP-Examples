1. Project Overview:
    This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USBX Host Hub driver with AZURE RTOS on Renesas RA MCUs based
    on Renesas FSP. The USB Host Hub functionality is demonstration is done by using HHID devices.USBX HHID driver enumerates 
    Human Interface Devices limited to keyboard or mouse using USBX middleware. Upon Connecting a keyboard and mouse to the hub, 
    pressing a key from the keyboard, the received keycode is displayed on the J-link RTT Viewer. When the mouse is moved, the 
    x and y axis position will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer. Error and info messages will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer.

2. Supported Boards:
    EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, MCK-RA8T1

3. Hardware Requirements:
        1. 1 x RA MCU board
        2. 1 x Micro USB cable for programming and debugging or 1 x Type C USB cable (For MCK-RA8T1)
        3. 1 x Micro USB 2.0 OTG cable or 1 x Type C USB 2.0 OTG cable (For MCK-RA8T1)
        4. 1 x USB Hub
        5. 1 x USB PC Keyboard
        6. 1 x USB Mouse

4. Hardware Connections:
    EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5 (Full Speed)

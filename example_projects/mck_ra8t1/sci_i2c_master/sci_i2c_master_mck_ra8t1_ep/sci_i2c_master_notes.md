# Introduction #

The example project demonstrates the typical use of the SCI I2C master HAL module APIs. The project initializes SCI I2C master module with the standard rate and interfaces with PmodACL™ Board for ADXL345.

On power up, after initializing and configuring the sensor, the RA MCU will read the axis acceleration data from the sensor and display it on the RTT Viewer every time new data is detected by an external interrupt

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the EP project.
2. Connect Pmod ACL module to RA board.
3. Connect RA board to Host PC.
4. Flash or debug the EP project.
5. Open the RTT Viewer and view output log.
  
  ![rtt_log](images/sci_i2c_rtt_log.png "J-Link RTT Viewer")

## Special Topics ##
* The files sci_i2c_ep.c and sci_i2c_ep.h contain the API for initialization, configuration and communication of the PmodACL module.
* Some MCUs do not support r_sci_i2c module but can use r_sci_b_i2c module instead.
* For the functioning of the SCI I2C Master:
1. SDA pin and SCL pin must configure output type as n-ch open drain.
2. SDA pin and SCL pin must be connected to external pull-up resistors.
3. The value of the external pull-up resistor depends on the I2C bus speed. In this EP project, the I2C bus is configured at standard speed, so the recommended external pull-up resistor value is from 1k to 4.7k ohms.
For MCK-RA8T1: Value of pull-up resistor is from 1k to 3.9k ohms.

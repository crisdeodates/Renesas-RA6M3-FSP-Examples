1. Project Overview:
	This Example Project demonstrates the functionality of AGT in periodic mode and one-shot mode.  On providing any 
	input on the RTTviewer, AGT channel 0 starts in one-shot mode. AGT channel 1 starts in periodic mode when AGT 
	channel 0 expires. Timer in periodic mode expires periodically at a time period specified by user and toggles the 
	on-board LED.
	
Note:
1) User is expected to enter data of size not exceeding above 15 bytes.
   Operation is not guaranteed for any user input value other than integer,char(i.e. float, special char) through RTT.

2) User can refer Section 5 "Example Project for IP Protection" in the document to run trustzone EP via link:
   https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-ra-security-design-arm-trustzone-ip-protection

3) For IAR, user can open non-secure (_ns) project. It included multiple workspace which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

4) For KEIL, user can open .uvmpw file in keil folder for multiple workspace which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

5) User must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.

6) The first compiling in non-secure (_ns) of IAR project may have issue with error message, this is because of timing issue 
   between EWARM and RSAC operation which described in step 10 of section 5.5.1 in
   https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-ra-security-design-arm-trustzone-ip-protection  

7) After building successfully, user must open Renesas Device Partition Manager -> Initialize device back to factory default -> Set Trustzone 
   secure / non-secure boundaries -> Run non-secure (_ns) project. 

8) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x320024b8
   b. Keil:	Not available
   c. IAR: 0x3200207c
 
9) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

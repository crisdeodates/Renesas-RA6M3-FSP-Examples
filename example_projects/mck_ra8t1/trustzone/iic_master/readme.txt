1. Project Overview:
    The example project demonstrates the typical use of the IIC master HAL module APIs.
    The project initializes IIC master module with standard rate and interfaces with PmodACL™ Board for ADXL345.

    On power up after establishing the connection of sensor with RA board, it displays accelerometer axis data on
    RTTviewer. Any API/event failure will be displayed on RTTviewer.

2. Software Requirements:
    Refer to the Tools section in the Release Notes for set up suitable Software version.
    https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Settings:
    Hardware Connection
    *******************
    PMOD ACL has two on board connectors, J2 is used for I2C communication.

    EK-RA6M4 / EK-RA6M5
    --------
    SDA0/P401  ----> SDA (on PMOD-ACL)
    SCL0/P400  ----> SCL (on PMOD-ACL)
    VCC pin    ----> VCC (on PMOD-ACL)
    GND pin    ----> GND (on PMOD-ACL)

    EK-RA4M3
    --------
    SDA0/P401  ----> SDA (on PMOD-ACL)
    SCL0/P408  ----> SCL (on PMOD-ACL)
    VCC pin    ----> VCC (on PMOD-ACL)
    GND pin    ----> GND (on PMOD-ACL)

Note:
1) For the functioning of IIC Master on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3/EK-RA6M3G/EK-RA8M1/EK-RA8D1 external pull up resistors of value
   3.9 or 4.7K ohms are required to be connected on I2C(SDA/SCL) lines.﻿

2) User should view section 5 of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run a trustzone project.
   https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-ra-security-design-arm-trustzone-ip-protection

3) For the IAR project, user can launch the Workspace using the .eww workspace file in the non-secure project folder. 
   It included multiple workspace which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

4) For the KEIL project, user can launch the Workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder. It included multiple workspace 
   which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

5) User must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.  

6) After the projects are built successfully, user should follow these three steps in sequence to launch the debug session:
   - Initialize device back to factory default. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Set Trustzone secure / non-secure boundaries. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Launch the Debug session from the non-secure project.

7) For IAR project, User can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack -> Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not
   valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch. 

8) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x32002628
   b. Keil:	0x32002008
   c. IAR: 	0x32002060
 
9) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

1. Project Overview:

	This Example Project demonstrates CAN-FD operations on Renesas RA MCUs using 2 RA boards.
        On pressing any key on the RTTViewer(connected to any one of the 2 boards), data is transmitted from Board1 to Board2.
        On data reception, Board2 displays the received data on the RTTViewer and Board2 transmits updated data back to Board1 as an acknowledgment. 
        Board1 on reception of data, changes mode from CAN frame to CAN-FD frame and transmits data to board2.
        On reception, board2 transmits updated data back to board1 as an acknowledgment. On successful transmission and reception,
        Boards prints the transmitted & received data on to RTTViewer.

2. Hardware Connections:
       Require 2 RA boards to run the project

      Note:
      1. In this example project, the same code runs on both boards. The board from which the user initiates the transmission becomes the board1
      and board which receives the data becomes board2.
      2. User is expected to enter data of size not exceeding above 15 bytes.
      3. For MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3, EK-RA8D1 and MCK-RA8T1
         a. Connect P3 loopback connection on CAN Transceiver Board with jumper cables instead of a db9 serial cable.
         b. Connect jumpers J3, J4, J5 and J6 on OM13099 (CAN Transceiver Board) to establish connection to CAN termination resistors.

3. Hardware Configuration:

- For EK-RA8D1: Set the configuration switches (SW1) as below to avoid potential failures.
	+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
	| SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
	+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
	|     OFF     |     OFF     |      OFF     |     OFF    |     OFF    |      OFF   |      OFF    |     OFF   |
	+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+	

	CAUTION: Do not enable SW1-4 and SW1-5 together

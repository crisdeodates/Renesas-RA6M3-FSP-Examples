1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the CRC HAL module APIs.
        The project demonstrates CRC operation for data transmission in normal mode and reception in snoop mode through sci interface.
	If board not support snoop mode (EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3), reception in normal mode through sci interface.
        On Pressing any key through RTT Viewer CRC value in normal mode is calculated for 4 bytes of data.
        The calculated CRC value along with input data is transmitted and received on sci_uart through loop-back.
        Once the transfer is complete, and if CRC value for snoop mode is zero and transmit and receive buffer are equal then On-board
        LED blinks as sign of successful CRC operation. On data mismatch, LED stays ON. Failure and status messages are displayed on
        RTT Viewer.

Note:
* For any event or API failure appropriate messages is displayed on RTT viewer.
* User can change the polynomial to CRC_16 and CRC_CCITT and bit order from MSB to LSB from CRC configurator and observe the results.
* The application does not work for CRC_32 bit polynomial.
* Please refer the latest FSP User Manual for comparison with popular online CRC calculator and the associated limitations are captured in it.

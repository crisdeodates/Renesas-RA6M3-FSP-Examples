# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB Host Composite (CDC and MSC) on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a Host Communications Device Class (HCDC) and as a Host Mass StorageClass (HMSC). The EP will present a menu list for user to communicate with both the PMSC and PCDC devices. The usb_composite EP can be used as the PCDC device and the PMSC device to demonstrate this USB Multi Host example. For HCDC operation, the host prompts the user to input text for transfer to the PCDC device and retrieves echoed data from the PCDC device. For HMSC operation, the EP performs File Operations such as Creating, Writing, Reading and Deleting of a file and USB Specific operations such as formatting, ejecting and reinitializing a USB drive.

In case only the PCDC device is connected or only the PMSC device is connected, The EP will provide the corresponding operation: USB CDC operation or USB MSC operation.

Note: 
  - Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via
    J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to
    the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer. If supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
  - To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please refer to the instructions provided in 
    the "Special Topic" section.
  - RA boards supported for J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8M1 and MCK-RA8T1.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Verifying operation ##

1. Import the example project.

    By default, the EP supports the serial terminal:

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

    To use SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer, please follow the instructions as below:

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

    * Note: By default, for RA boards that do not support J-Link OB VCOM (EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3,EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, and EK-RA6M5), the EP information is printed via the J-Link RTT Viewer.
    
2. Double click Configuration.xml file, and click Generate Project Content. Next, build the project.
3. Connect the RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable.
4. Open a serial terminal application on the host PC (Tera Term) and connect to the COM Port provided by the J-Link onboard or open J-link RTT Viewer (In case user selected SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer).

   * Note: For using the serial terminal:
        * Please ensure that the connection to the RTT Viewer has been terminated if it was previously established.
        * The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.

5. Debug or flash the EP project to the RA board.
6. After the main menu is displayed on the terminal application, the user can select options to perform USB operations.
  * The images below showcase the output on the serial terminal application (Tera Term)

## Special Topic ##
To change USB speed mode, users can refer to the following configuration:

* USB High-speed configuration with DMAC support:

 ![USB_hs_config](images/usb_hs_configuration_1.png "g_basic")

 ![USB_hs_config](images/usb_hs_configuration_2.png "g_transfer 0")

 ![USB_hs_config](images/usb_hs_configuration_3.png "g_transfer 1")

 * USB Full-speed configuration with DMAC support:

 ![USB_fs_config](images/usb_fs_configuration_1.png "g_basic")

 ![USB_fs_config](images/usb_fs_configuration_2.png "g_transfer 0")

 ![USB_fs_config](images/usb_fs_configuration_3.png "g_transfer 1")

Special notes:

* For HMSC operation:
	1) Format the USB drive (with FAT16/FAT32 file system) before performing any operation. Due to limitations in RAM size on MCU, we are  unable to format (FAT16 or FAT32) the USB drive when testing with composite EP.
	2) Data written can also be manually verified in file ra_usb.txt.
	3) User is expected to execute "safely_eject" option before removing USB else further file operations may fail and USB data may get corrupted.
	4) If USB is removed without "safely_eject" option, user is recommended to perform "safely_eject" and re-initialise USB. This will make sure no USB operations fail after unexpected removal of USB.

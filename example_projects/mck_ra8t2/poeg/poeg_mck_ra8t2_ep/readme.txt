1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of the Port Output Enable for GPT (POEG) driver on Renesas
	RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. The user can disable the GPT output pins using one of the following options:
	1. Disable GPT output pins based on the GTETRG input pin level.
	2. Disable GPT output pins by software API.
	3. Disable GPT output pins when GTIOC pins are at the same logic level.
	4. Disable GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) crossing events.
	5. Reset the POEG status.
	Information, guideline and error messages are displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer. LED1 is turned ON when the GPT 
	output pin is disabled successfully. LED1 is turned OFF when POEG reset successfully. Additionally, the user can
	verify the EP operation using a logic analyzer.

	Note: EK-RA4L1, EK-RA2L2, EK-RA4C1 boards do not support disabling GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) 
	      crossing events.

	The user can refer the "Verifying Operation" section to run the example project properly.

5. Verifying Operation:
	To run this example project, follow below instructions to observe the EP operation:
	
	1. Import, Generate and Build the example project.

	2. Connect the USB debug port on the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

	3. Download/Debug the example project to the RA board.

	4. Run the project and open J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output status.

	5. For FPB-RA2T1: When using option 1 (triggering POEG by GTETRG input pin level) or option 2 (triggering POEG
	   by software API), ensure that pin P015 (J4:14), which is configured as the analog input voltage source and
	   is in a high-impedance (Hi-Z) state, has a voltage lower than 1.44V. This helps prevent accidental
	   triggering by the comparator detection signals (option 4).
	   
	6. To disable GPT output pins based on the GTETRG input pin level, enter "1": The POEG1 channel number corresponds
	   to the GTETRG input pin which is used with this channel. GTETRG pin level (active LOW or active HIGH based on
	   configuration) disables GPT output pins on the input level.
	   - After selecting option 1, refer to the guidelines on RTT Viewer or "Hardware Connection" section to connect
	     hardware properly. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".
	   - Remove connection of GTETRG pin and reset of application are needed prior to repeatedly selecting menu 
	     option "1", or selecting other options from the menu (except option "5")
	   
	7. To disable GPT output pins by software API, enter "2": The GPT output pins are disabled on 
	   R_POEG_OutputDisable() software API. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".

	8. To disable GPT output pins when GTIOC pins are at the same logic level, enter "3": The GPT output pins are
	   disabled when the GTIOC pins are on the same level. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu
	   option "5".

	9. Before running menu option "4", refer to "Hardware Connections" section to connect hardware correctly.
 	   To disable GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) crossing events, enter "4": The GPT output pins
	   are disabled on comparator crossing events. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".
	   - Reset of the application is needed prior to repeatedly selecting menu option "4" or selecting other menu
	     options (except option "5") to restart DAC0, DAC1, and ACMPHS.
	   - For FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA8E2:
	     a. Internal Reference Voltage (Vref) is used as reference voltage source and AN000 is used as input voltage
	        source for ACMPHS module, which is supplied by output of DAC0. The user can enter DAC0 value within
	        permitted range to provide an analog signal input for AN000. Reset of the application is needed prior 
	        to repeatedly selecting menu option "4" or selecting other menu options (except option "5") to restart
	        DAC0 and ACMPHS.
	     b. Internal Reference Voltage (Vref) is used as reference voltage source, it is set to 1.18V (Equivalent to
	        a digital value 1465).
	     c. The user has to input DAC0 value in between (0 - 1400) or (1600 - 4095) to prevent voltage fluctuations
	        caused by electrical noise, which may affect the comparator output.
	   - For FPB- RA2T1:
	     a. Internal Reference Voltage (Vref: 1.44V) is used as reference voltage source and CMPIN01 is used as input
	        voltage source for ACMPHS module, which is supplied by external DC power supply. Reset of the application
	        is needed prior to repeatedly selecting menu option "4" or selecting other menu options (except option "5")
	        to restart ACMPHS.
	     b. The user needs to provide an analog signal by using an external variable DC power supply, instead of
	        inputting DAC values through the RTT Viewer. 
	     c. When the input voltage source is greater than the reference voltage (1.44V), POEG is triggered to request
	        stopping the output in response to detection by the comparator.
	  
	10. To reset POEG channel 0 (Required after running option 3): enter "5", then enter "1".
	    To reset POEG channel 1 (Required after running options 1, 2, or 4): enter "5", then enter "2".
	
	11. Verify the POEG operation through output status on RTT Viewer, LED behavior or
	    waveform on a Logic Analyzer (optional).

Note:
1) For FPB-RA2T1, the user must Close E8, E15 and Cut E10 to use P213 for LED1.

2) To verify the EP operation waveform with a Logic Analyzer, see the 'Special Topics' section in the poeg_notes.md file.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000450
   b. Keil:     Not Available
   c. IAR:      Not Available
 
4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

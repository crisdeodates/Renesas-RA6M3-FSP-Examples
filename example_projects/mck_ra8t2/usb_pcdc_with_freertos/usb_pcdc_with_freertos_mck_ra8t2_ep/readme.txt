1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the USB PCDC driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas 
	FSP using FreeRTOS. In this example, the user will be able to use the RA board as a CDC to UART converter by
	connecting through a COM port from the host PC. The converter performs the data reception and data transmission
	asynchronously. The user can connect any UART device to receive the data typed in Tera Term, and to send any
	data to the converter to display on Tera Term. The user can also change the baud rate, stop bit and parity bit
	configuration at run time through Tera Term. The status of the application will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

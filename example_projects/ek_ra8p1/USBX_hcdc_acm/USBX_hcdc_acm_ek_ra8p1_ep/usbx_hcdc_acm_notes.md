# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Host CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. Board 1 acts as Host device running USBX HCDC-ACM example project and Board 2 acts as Peripheral device running USBX PCDC-ACM example project and connected with type-C USB cable via OTG. 
The peripheral initiates the communication and once the host reads the data initiated by the peripheral. The host will then send predefined data to the peripheral and the device will echo the data back to the host. 
The application status messages will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

The table below lists the FSP provided API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _ux_system_initialize | This API is used to initialize the USBx system. |
| ux_host_stack_initialize | This API is used to initialize the USBx device stack. |
| ux_host_class_cdc_acm_write | This API is used to write to the CDC class. |
| ux_host_class_cdc_acm_read | This API is used to read from the CDC class. |
| R_USB_Open|This API is used to open the USB basic driver. |

**Callback:**  
The ux_host_usr_event_notification callback function is called to identify the USB events and perform operation as per the received events. Also, there are only two events available in the EP, they are used to signal the HCDC that USB communication can be started.
1. When the event UX_FSP_DEVICE_INSERTION is received the USBX_HCDC checks for the CDC class interface and sets the event flag to perform USBX_HCDC operations (e.g., write/read).
2. When the event UX_FSP_DEVICE_REMOVAL is received the USBX_HCDC will clear the event flag and wait for USB_INSERTION event.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the USBX PCDC ACM and USBX HCDC ACM EPs.
2. Now, flash USBX PCDC ACM code on RA board (e.g., board 2) which will act as peripheral device.
3. Open J-Link RTT Viewer for board 2.
4. Next, flash USBX HCDC ACM code on another RA board (e.g., board 1) which will act as host device.
5. Open J-Link RTT Viewer for board 1 and verify host device operation.

**Note:** Both USBX HCDC ACM and USBX PCDC ACM need to be running at High Speed or Full Speed for the EP functionality to work correctly.

## Special Topics ##
* How to Switch between USB FS and HS for MCU supporting both USB speed:
1. Select the USB Speed and USB Module Number from the configuration property as per supported USB speed.
2. Configure the DMA Source Address and DMA Destination Address, according to the USB speed selected.

3. When using DMAC, Configure the transfer size as per the selected USB Speed (e.g., For FS: 2 bytes and HS: 4 bytes).

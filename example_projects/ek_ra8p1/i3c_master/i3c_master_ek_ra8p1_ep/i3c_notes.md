**Note :** MD file is common for both i3c_master and i3c_slave EP.

# Introduction # 
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of the I3C Driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. The I3C master on RA board demonstrates operations associated with an I3C slave running on another RA board. Once initialization is successful, I3C Master device assigns slave address to I3C slave device through DAA (dynamic address assignment) using I3C common command code (CCC). Once Dynamic Address Assignment is completed, the Master EP performs write/read operations, and displays slave device information based on user input. If the on-board switch is pressed on the slave side, it will initiate an IBI transfer request. The application status messages will be displayed in the J-Link RTT Viewer and on-board LEDs. Refer **[LED Status](#led-status)** section for LED observation.

Note: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8P1 boards support I3C HDR-DDR mode. The Master EP can perform write/read operations both in the SDR mode and HDR-DDR mode.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import, generate and build both i3c_master and i3c_slave EPs in different workspaces. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are done on both master and slave sides.
2. Download i3c_master EP to one RA MCU and run the project.
3. Download i3c_slave EP to another RA MCU and run the project.
4. Now open one J-Link RTT Viewer and connect to the master board and open another/second J-Link RTT Viewer and connect it to slave board.
5. The user can perform Menu option operations on the master side and check corresponding results for the Master and Slave EPs on the respective J-Link RTT Viewer.
6. Also on slave side the user can perform IBI transfer request using Push button (SW2) and verify result on J-Link RTT Viewer. For MCK-RA4T1/MCK-RA6T3: The user needs to use Toggle switch (S1) instead.

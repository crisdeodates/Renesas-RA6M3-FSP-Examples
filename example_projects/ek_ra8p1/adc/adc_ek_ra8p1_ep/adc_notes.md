# Introduction #
 
This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of ADC driver, including the ADC's Window Compare Mode on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. An J-link RTT Viewer input command triggers the ADC scan to read the analog data of adc channel and outputs the converted data onto the J-link RTT Viewer output. The project initializes the ADC in Single Scan or Continuous Scan mode based on the user selection in RA Configurator. Once initialized, the user can initiate the ADC scan and also stop the scan (in the case of Continuous Scan mode) using J-Link RTT Viewer by sending commands. The user provides ADC channel input voltage from 0V to 3.3V with a variable power supply unit at the ADC channel voltage input pin. Once ADC scan is initialized, Window Compare Mode is enabled and compares the ADC channel input voltage with the upper and lower limits. The upper limit and lower limit are configured in RA Configurator. If the ADC channel input voltage is above the upper limit or below the lower limit, it triggers an event and notifies the user to  act accordingly. Result and ADC status is displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

Note:
* FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2 do not support Window Compare Mode and operate with One-shot or Sequential mode.
* MCK-RA6T2 does not support Window Compare Mode and operates with internal temperature sensor.
* EK-RA8P1 does not support Window Compare Mode.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the example project. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are done.
2. Download the example project to the Renesas RA board and run the project.
3. Open J-Link RTT Viewer and connect to the Renesas RA board.
4. The user can perform Menu option operations and check the corresponding results J-Link RTT Viewer.
5. Also the user can supply input voltage to ADC scan channel pin and verify result on J-Link RTT Viewer.
6. If the ADC value is outside the window compare, it status is shown in the J-Link RTT Viewer.
	* The Boundary values of ADC Window Compare Mode are:
		* Lower Reference is 1.0V
		* Upper Reference is 2.5V.  
		* Reference Voltage is 3.3V.  
	* Note: FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2, MCK-RA6T2, EK-RA8P1 do not support Window Compare Mode.

## ADC Value calculation ##

   Digital Output = (2^n * Analog input voltage)/(Reference Voltage)
          n = Number of bits
		  Digital Output is then converted to its Binary Equivalent

   For Example:
   1) If the Analog input voltage is 1.5V
   
    	For 12-bit ADC
		Digital Output = (2^12 * 1.5)/3.3
		               = (4096 * 1.5)/3.3
					   = 6144/3.3
		Digital Output = 1861
		
		For 16-bit ADC
		Digital Output = (2^15 * 1.5)/3.3
		               = (32768 * 1.5)/3.3
					   = 49152/3.3
		Digital Output = 14894
	
	Note: Limitation for 16-bit ADC - Refer: Table 32.13 A/D conversion result output ranges of each A/D conversion in the RA2A1 User Manual (R01UH0888EJ0100 Rev.1.00)

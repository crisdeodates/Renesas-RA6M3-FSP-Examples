 kBufferSize_sub_0000_net1 is a compile-time constant to be used by the user of compute_sub_0000_net1 function
 to allocate a buffer with at least the specified size.

 Example of how to call the compute function:

   // it is possible to use either heap, stack or a custom data section to allocate this buffer
   uint8_t my_buffer[kBufferSize_sub_0000_net1];

   int main() {
     ...
     compute_sub_0000_net1(my_buffer, input, output);

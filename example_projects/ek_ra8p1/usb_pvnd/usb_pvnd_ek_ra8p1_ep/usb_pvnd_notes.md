# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying with this file shows operation of a Peripheral Vendor class using the USB FS peripheral on a RA MCU. In this example, the application will configure the USB IP on the MCU as a Vendor Peripheral device. This Peripheral device will be connected to another RA MCU operating as USB Host servicing Vendor class requests. After the enumeration is completed, the Vendor Peripheral board will write a fixed amount (default: 15 Bytes) of data to the Vendor Host board which is relayed back by the Host.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| USB Peripheral Vendor |USB Peripheral Vendor class works by combining r_usb_basic module. | USB pvnd |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread -> g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > Properties > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > USB Callback | NULL | usb_peri_vendor_callback | As RTOS is used, so the callback function is set and this callback function will notify the user about occurrence of usb events. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread -> g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > Properties > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > USB Speed | Full Speed | Full Speed | Select the USB speed. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread -> g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > Properties > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > USB Module Number | USB_IP0 Port | USB_IP0 Port | Specify the USB module number to be used. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Stack size (bytes) | 1024 | 4096 | This is changed to handle its worst-case function call nesting and local variable usage. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation | Static | Dynamic | RTOS objects can be created using RAM that is automatically allocated from the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Total Heap Size | 1024 | 40000 | This is changed because Dynamic Allocation support is enabled, so application makes use of amount of RAM available in the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Peri Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Support Dynamic Allocation | Disabled | Enabled | This is changed to allocate memory for this object from a FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > g_queue Queue > Properties > Settings > Property > Memory Allocation | Static | Dynamic | This is changed to allocate memory for this object from a FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > g_queue Queue > Properties > Settings > Property > Queue Length (Items) | 20 | 10 | Queue length is assigned. |

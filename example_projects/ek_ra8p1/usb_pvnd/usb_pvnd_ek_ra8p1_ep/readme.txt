1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB Peripheral Vendor class driver on Renesas RA MCUs
	based on Renesas FSP. In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a Vendor Peripheral device.
	This Peripheral device will be connected to the USB Host Vendor device which is another RA board. After the
	enumeration is completed, the Vendor Peripheral board will read 15 Bytes of data from the Vendor Host board
	and write back the same data to the Vendor Host board. The Vendor Host and Vendor Peripheral applications are
	designed to continuously transfer data between both the boards. The user will be able to see all the operation
	sequence and status on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA2A1, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6E2, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3,
			     EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1
	2 x Renesas RA boards:
		- 1 x RA board runs the USB PVND Example Project.
		- 1 x RA board runs the USB HVND Example Project.
    	1 x USB OTG cable.
        3 x Type-C USB cables.
		- 2 x Type-C USB cables for programming and debugging.
		- 1 x Type-C USB cable used to connect the RA board1 to the RA board2 through OTG cable.

3. Configuration Settings:
	To select USB Speed in configuration:
    	i.  Full-Speed: (For EK-RA2A1, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6E2, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M4,
		             EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1)
            USB Speed                     :    Full Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP0 Port

    	ii. High-Speed: (For EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G)
            USB Speed                     :    Hi Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP1 Port

4. Hardware Connections:

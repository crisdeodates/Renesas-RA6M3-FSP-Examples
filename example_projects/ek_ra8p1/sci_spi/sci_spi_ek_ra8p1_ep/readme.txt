1. Project Overview:
     	This example project demonstrates the basic usage of SCI_SPI driver. The project writes commands to the 
	temperature module MAX31723PMB1 and reads the temperature value using SCI_SPI bus which is configured as master.
     	The temperature values are continuously printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	1 x Temperature sensor MAX31723PMB1 (e.g., https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Analog-Devices-Maxim-Integrated/MAX31723PMB1?qs=UmMSjoC1xtH8e742i4OoUA%3D%3D).
	Some jumper wires used to connect the Temperature sensor to the RA board.

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000470
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

3) For GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: To enable printing floats to the RTT Viewer, edit the project settings and ensure that
   "Use float with nano printf" is enabled. The setting can be found by:
   Properties > C/C++ Build > Settings > Tool Settings > GNU Arm Cross C Linker > Miscellaneous > Use float with nano printf

# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of the DAC, AGT, and DTC modules to generate a continuous sinusoidal signal on a RA MCU. The user is prompted to set the output signal's samples per period and frequency via J-Link RTT Viewer. The program first calculates one period of the sinusoidal signal stores it in a lookup table. Then, the samples per period and frequency are used to calculate and configure the counts per timer cycle of the AGT. After the AGT module is started, every AGT cycle triggers the DTC to transfer the next value of the lookup table to the DADR0 register and the corresponding voltage is output to the D/A output pin. The desired output sinusoidal wave will oscillate between the minimum and maximum DAC values at the user-specified samples per period and frequency.

For MCK-RA8T1: The AGT generates an interrupt which triggers the DTC to transfer the next value of the LUT to the DADR1 register.

### Generating Different Periodic Signals ### 
This program generates a continuous output signal by repeatedly iterating through one period of the sine function in a lookup table. The user can generate additional periodic signals with this program by replacing the sine function with other periodic functions in the code section for calculating the lookup table. 

**E.g., Triangle Wave:** 

To edit the program to generate a triangle wave, replace the code in **generate_lut()** function of **hal_entry.c** file with the following code:

```c
        int duty_cycle = 50;
        int cutoff = (input_spp)*(duty_cycle/100);
        uint16_t b = (uint16_t)(4095 + (4095/(input_spp - cutoff))*cutoff);
        uint16_t m1 = (uint16_t)(4095/cutoff);
        uint16_t m2 = (uint16_t)(-4095/(input_spp - cutoff));

        for(int i = 0; i < cutoff; ++i )
        {
            look_up_table[i] = (uint16_t)(m1*i);
        }

        for(int i = cutoff; i < input_spp; ++i)
        {
            look_up_table[i] = (uint16_t)(m2*i+b);
        }
```

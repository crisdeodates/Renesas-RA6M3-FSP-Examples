1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates SCI_I2C Master operation through loopback with IIC Slave driver.
	6 bytes of data will be transmitted and received continuously on successful initialization. 
	The transmitted data is compared with the received data. If the data matches, on-board LED starts blinking.
	On a data mismatch, LED stays ON. Failure messages and status is displayed on RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	2 x Jumper wires.

3. Hardware Connections:
	Jumper wires are required to establish loopback connection along IIC lines on the board with pins as
	mentioned below:

1) For the functioning of SCI_I2C Master and IIC Slave on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, FPB-RA6E1,
   FPB-RA4E1, FPB-RA2E3, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA2A2, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1 external pull up resistors of
   value 3.9 or 4.7k ohms are required to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.

2) For EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 value of external pull up resistors is 1.0k ohms.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000450
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available

4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

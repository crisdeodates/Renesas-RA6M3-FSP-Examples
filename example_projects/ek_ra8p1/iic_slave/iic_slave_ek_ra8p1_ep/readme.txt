1. Project Overview:
    	The example project demonstrates typical use of the IIC Slave HAL module APIs. The project initializes IIC
	Slave and IIC Master modules with standard rate and is made interfaced with loop-back mechanism. It performs
	Slave read and write operation continuously once initialization is successful. On successful I2C transaction
	(6 bytes), data transceived is compared. LED blinks on data match else it is turned ON as sign of failure.
	Output message for both corresponding Slave operations is displayed on RTT Viewer. Any API/event failure
	message is also displayed.

2. Hardware Requirements:

Note:
1) DTC transfer support is configurable and is enabled in the configurator. DTC is helpful for minimizing interrupts
   during large transactions.
   Note: For FPB-RA0E2 board, DTC does not support for IICA module.

2) For the functioning of IIC Slave on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, FPB-RA6E1, EK-RA2L1, EK-RA8D1,
   EK-RA8M1, EK-RA2A2, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1 external pull up resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7k ohms are required
   to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220004b0
   b. Keil:	0x22000c50
   c. IAR: 0x220009c8
 
4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

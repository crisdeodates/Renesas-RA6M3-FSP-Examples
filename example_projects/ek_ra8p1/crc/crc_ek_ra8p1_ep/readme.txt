1. Project Overview:
	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the CRC HAL module APIs. It demonstrates CRC operation for
	data transmission in normal mode and reception in snoop mode through SCI interface. If the board does not
	support snoop mode (EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3, EK-RA4L1), reception is performed in normal mode
	through SCI interface. If the board does not support snoop mode (FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2), reception is performed
	in normal mode through SAU interface. On pressing any key through RTT Viewer, CRC value in normal mode is
	calculated for 4 bytes of data. The calculated CRC value and input data are transmitted and received through
	loopback on SCI_UART (except for FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2 which use SAU_UART). Once the transfer is complete, if
	CRC value for snoop mode is zero and the transmit and receive buffers are equal, the on-board LED blinks as a
	sign of successful CRC operation. On data mismatch, LED stays ON. Failure and status messages are displayed on
	RTT Viewer.

Note:
1) For any event or API failure, appropriate messages are displayed on the RTT Viewer.

2) The user can change the polynomial to CRC_16 and CRC_CCITT and bit order from MSB to LSB from CRC configurator and
   observe the results (For FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2 only supports CRC_CCITT and LSB).

3) The application does not work for CRC_32 bit polynomial.

4) Please refer the latest FSP User Manual for comparison with popular online CRC calculator and the associated
   limitations are captured in it.

5) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000450
   b. Keil:     Not Available
   c. IAR:      Not Available

6) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

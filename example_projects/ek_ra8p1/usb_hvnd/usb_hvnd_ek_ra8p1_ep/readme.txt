1. Project Overview:
   	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB Host Vendor class driver on Renesas RA MCUs based 
	on Renesas FSP. In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a Vendor Host device. This host 
	device will be connected to the USB Peripheral Vendor device which is another RA board. After the enumeration
	is completed, the Vendor Host board will write 15 bytes of data to the Vendor Peripheral board and read back
	the same data from the Vendor Peripheral board. The Vendor Host and Vendor Peripheral applications are designed
 	to continuously transfer data between both the boards. The user will be able to see all the operation sequence
	and status on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8M1, MCK-RA8T1,
			     EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1.
	2 x Renesas RA boards:
		- 1 x RA board runs the USB HVND Example Project.
		- 1 x RA board runs the USB PVND Example Project.
	1 x Type-C USB OTG cable.
        3 x Type-C USB cables.
		- 2 x Type-C USB cables for programming and debugging.
		- 1 x Type-C USB cable used to connect the RA board 1 to the RA board 2 through Type-C USB OTG cable.

3. Configuration Settings:
	To select USB Speed in configuration:
    	i.  Full-Speed: (For EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2,
			     EK-RA8P1)
            USB Speed                     :    Full Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP0 Port

    	ii. High-Speed: (For EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA8P1)
            USB Speed                     :    Hi Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP1 Port

4. Hardware Connections:
	Connect USB debug ports of the two RA boards to USB ports of the host PC via two USB cables.
	Connect board 1, running USB HVND example project, through OTG cable to board 2, running USB PVND example project.

		Jumper J12 placement is pins 1-2.
		Remove jumper J15 pins.
		Connect micro-AB USB Full Speed port (J11) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

	For MCK-RA8T1 (Full-Speed):
		Jumper JP9 placement is pins 1-2.
		Remove jumper JP10 pins.
		Connect Type-C USB Full Speed port (CN14) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

	For EK-RA4L1 (Full-Speed):
		The user must turn OFF S4-4 to select USB Host Controller mode.
		Set J17 jumper to pins 2-3, Set J7 jumper to use P407 for USBFS VBUS.
		Connect Type-C USB Full Speed port (J11) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

	For EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1 (Full-Speed):
		Connect Type-C USB Full Speed port (J11) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

	For EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G (High-Speed):
        	Jumper J7 placement is pins 1-2.
		Remove jumper J17 pins.
		Connect micro-AB USB High Speed port (J6) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

	For EK-RA8P1 (High-Speed):
		Connect Type-C USB High Speed port (J7) of the board to the board 2 through OTG cable.

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220004f0
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

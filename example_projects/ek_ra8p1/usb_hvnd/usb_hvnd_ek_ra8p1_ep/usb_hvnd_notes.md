# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a Host Vendor Class using the USB FS or HS host interface on a RA MCU. In this example, the application will configure the USB IP on the MCU as a Vendor Host device. This host device will be connected to another RA MCU operating as USB Peripheral that handles Vendor Class requests. After the enumeration is completed, the Vendor Host board will write a fixed amount of data (default: 15 bytes) to the Vendor Peripheral board and which is relayed back by the Peripheral.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| USB Host Vendor |USB Host Vendor class works by combining r_usb_basic module. | USB hvnd |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Host Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Stack size (bytes) | 1024 | 4096 | This is changed to handle its worst-case function call nesting and local variable usage. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Host Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation | Static | Dynamic | This is changed to allocate memory for this object from a FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Host Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Support Dynamic Allocation | Disabled | Enabled | RTOS objects can be created using RAM that is automatically allocated from the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Host Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Total Heap Size | 0 | 20000 | This is changed because Dynamic Allocation support is enabled, so application makes use of amount of RAM available in the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > g_queue Queue > Properties > Settings > Property > Memory Allocation | Static | Dynamic | This is changed to allocate memory for this object from a FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > g_queue Queue > Properties > Settings > Property > Queue Length (Items) | 20 | 10 | Queue length is assigned. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Host Thread > g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > Properties > Settings > Property > Module g_basic USB (r_usb_basic) > USB Callback | NULL | usb_host_vendor_callback | As RTOS is used, so the callback function is set and this callback function will notify the user about occurrence of USB events. |

# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USB PHID + PHID Composite Device on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. The RA board is configured to function as either a Keyboard or a Mouse.

On pressing "k" from  the RTT Viewer, the MCU will work as a Keyboard. The MCU sends characters a to z and numbers 0 to 9 to the host PC.

On pressing "m" from the RTT Viewer, the MCU will work as a Mouse. The MCU sends mouse coordinates to the host PC, making the pointer move in a square pattern on the host PC screen.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the USB PHID + PHID Composite Device example project, the following resources are needed.

### Software ###

    * Jumper JP9: Connect pins 2-3.
    * Connect the jumper JP10 pins.
    * Connect Type-C USB Full-Speed port (CN14) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.
    * Connect Type-C USB Debug port (CN11) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

* For EK-RA4L1:
    * Turn ON S4-4 to select USB device mode.
    * Set J17 jumper to pins 2-3, Set J7 jumper to use P407 for USBFS VBUS.
    * Connect Type-C USB Full-Speed port (J11) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.
    * Connect Type-C USB Debug port (J10) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

* For EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1:
    * Connect Type-C USB Full-Speed port (J11) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.
    * Connect Type-C USB Debug port (J10) of the board to USB port of the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage | Searchable Keyword  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|USB Composite | USB composite device works as a USB Peripheral by combining two peripheral device classes and r_usb_basic module. | r_usb_composite |
|USB PHID | The r_usb_phid module combines with the r_usb_basic module to provide a USB Peripheral Human Interface Device Class (PHID) driver. | r_usb_phid |
|USB basic | The r_usb_basic module operates in combination with the device class drivers provided by Renesas to form a complete USB stack. | r_usb_basic |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default.

**Common Configuration Properties**
|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Phid Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Common > General > Max Priorities | 5 | 15 | Match with maximum interrupt priority in USB Basic. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Phid Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Support Dynamic Allocation | Disabled | Enabled | RTOS objects can be created using RAM that is automatically allocated from the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Phid Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Memory Allocation > Total Heap Size | 0 | 10000 | This is changed because Dynamic Allocation support is enabled, so application makes use of amount of RAM available in the FreeRTOS heap. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Phid Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Stack size (bytes) | 1024 | 2048 | This is changed to handle its worst-case function call nesting and local variable usage. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > Phid Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Priority | 1 | 5 | This is changed to set thread priority. |

The table below lists the FSP provided API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R_USB_Open | This API is used to open the USB basic driver. |
| R_USB_PeriControlDataGet | This API is used to receive data from the host when receiving the USB_STATUS_REQUEST or USB_SET_REPORT event. |
| R_USB_PeriControlDataSet | This API is used to perform USB transfer to the keyboard or mouse when receiving the USB_GET_REPORT_DESCRIPTOR, or USB_GET_HID_DESCRIPTOR event. |
| R_USB_PeriControlStatusSet | This API is used to set the response to the setup packet. |
| R_USB_Write | This API is used to write data to the host when receiving USB_STATUS_REQUEST_COMPLETE or USB_STATUS_WRITE_COMPLETE event. |
| R_USB_Close | This API is used to close the USB basic driver. |

## Verifying operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP (see section Starting Development of FSP User Manual). After running the EP, open the J-Link RTT Viewer and choose whether to use the RA board as a keyboard or mouse.

* Keyboard:
In RTT Viewer, choose k

![usb_phid_phid](images/RTT_Viever_Keyboard.png "Choose K Keyboard")

Open Notepad on the PC, lower cases a - z, and numbers 0 - 9 will be shown on the Notepad.

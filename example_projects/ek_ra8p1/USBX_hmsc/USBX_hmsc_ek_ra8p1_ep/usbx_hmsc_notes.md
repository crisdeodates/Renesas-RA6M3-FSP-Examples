# Introduction #
This example project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USBX Host Mass Storage Class (HMSC) driver with Azure RTOS + FileX file system on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. FileX interface on USBX uses the underlying USB HMSC driver to perform various file operations on the USB storage devices based on user input from the menu. Status of application will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

* Callback:  
ux_host_usr_event_notification callback function is called to identify the USB events and perform operation as per the received events, also there are only two events available in the EP, they are used to signal the HMSC that USB communication can be started.
1. When the event UX_FSP_DEVICE_INSERTION is received the USBX_HMSC checks for the MSC class interface and sets the event flag to perform the USBX_HMSC operations (e.g., create directory, write, read, eject, display).
2. When the event UX_FSP_DEVICE_REMOVAL is received the USBX_HMSC will clear the event flag and wait for the USB_INSERTION event.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the EP.
2. Download USBX HMSC project into the RA board which will act as host device.
3. Open RTT Viewer and perform host device operation as per menu option.
4. The images below showcase the output on J-Link RTT Viewer for USBX HMSC:

 ![usbx_hmsc_rtt_log](images/USBX_HMSC_RTT_log1.jpg "RTT output")

 ![usbx_hmsc_rtt_log](images/USBX_HMSC_RTT_log4.jpg "RTT output")

## Special Topics ##
* The user is expected to execute the "Eject" option before removing USB else further file operations may fail and USB data may get corrupted.
* Operation is not guaranteed for any user input value other than int or char types (e.g., float, special characters) through J-Link RTT Viewer input.

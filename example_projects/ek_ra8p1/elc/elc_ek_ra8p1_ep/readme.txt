1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ELC HAL module APIs. ELC Software Event, GPT6 and GPT0
	events are linked using ELC. The start source for GPT6 and GPT0 is ELC Software Event, and the stop source for
	GPT6 is GPT0 counter overflow. GPT6 runs in PWM mode, and GPT0 runs in One-Shot mode. On giving valid J-Link
	RTT Viewer input, an ELC Software Event is generated that triggers LED blinking. LED stops blinking after 5
	seconds when GPT0 expires.

	For FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2:
	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ELC HAL module APIs. ELC Software Event, TAU0 and TAU1
	events are linked using ELC. The start source for TAU1 is ELC Software Event and the start source for TAU0 is
	end of counter TAU1. TAU0 runs in One-Shot pulse output mode, and TAU1 runs in delay counter mode. On giving
	valid RTT Viewer input, an ELC software Event is generated that turns ON LED1 after 1 second. LED1 turns ON for
	2 seconds until request pulse width expires.

Note:
1) The user is expected to enter data not exceeding 15 bytes in size.

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000430
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

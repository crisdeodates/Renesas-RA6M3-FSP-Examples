# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of NetX Secure Crypto on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP supporting SCE7/SCE9/RSIP-E51A/RSIP-E11A/RSIP-E50D hardware acceleration using AzureRTOS. The example project executes AES, ECC, RSA algorithms (including different chaining modes) in multi-threaded environment using mutex to enable access to SCE/RSIP. The user can enter any key to enable concurrent execution of the different algorithms and status of the execution will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

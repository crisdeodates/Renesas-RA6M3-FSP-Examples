1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates some of the capabilities of the EK and FSP by using multiple peripherals.
        The project initializes the QSPI, MIPI CSI, GLCD and GPIO modules along with various supporting stacks to create 
        an interactive user demo.

        There is a serial console which can be activated by connecting USB cable to DEBUG1 (J10), 
        connection settings are Speed 115200, Data 8-bit, Parity None, Stop 1-bit, Flow Control None.
        Once application is running the user can control the board by button presses on the board and see regularly updated 
        board configuration on the kit information screen using the serila console. 
        Attaching the LCD panel (supplied) a user can interact with the application using the screen.
        Attach OV5640 camera module in addition to the panel to allow 'Display' demo on application menu or option 4 on console

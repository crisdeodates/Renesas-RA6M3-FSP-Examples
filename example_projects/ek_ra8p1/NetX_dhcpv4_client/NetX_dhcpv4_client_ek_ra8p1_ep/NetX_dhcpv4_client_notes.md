# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of Netx Duo DHCPv4 client with an ethernet driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. DHCP client is created and started. On successful receiving of IP address from DHCPv4 server, it pings the server to verify the received IP address. On successful completion, the success status and IP address are displayed on the RTT Viewer. The error and info messages will be printed on RTT Viewer.

NetX Duo DHCP Client is compliant with [RFC2132](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132), [RFC2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131).

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage  | Searchable Keyword (using New Stack > Search) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| NetX Duo DHCP IPV4 Client | DHCPv4 module is used to obtain IP addresses, network parameters and to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. | dhcp |

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different from those selected by default.

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |

## Verifying Operation ##
* Import, build and debug the EP (see section Starting Development of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output.
* Before running the example project, refer the steps below for hardware connections:
    * Connect RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.
    * Connect an Ethernet cable to the J15 connector on RA board via ethernet switch/hub which is connected to Router or LAN where DHCP server is residing.
    * A DHCP server needs to exist on the network to assign an IP address to the RA board running this DHCP client example project.

# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USB Composite driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a CDC device as well as a Mass storage device. Tera Term is used to communicate with the CDC interface of the MCU. Data written by the Tera Term will be echoed back on the terminal by RA board. The user at the same time can read/write the data from/to the Mass storage device using host machine.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Verifying Operation ##
1) Import and build the EP. 
2) Set up hardware connection properly.
3) Debug/Download the EP into the RA board.
4) Open the J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output.
5) Check device enumeration in **Device Manager**.
6) Open the Tera Term:
    * Select the correct COM port.
    * To echo back what was typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].
    * Set parameters of the serial port: Speed, Data, Parity, Stop bits through [Setup] -> [Serial port...].
    * Type input to execute write and read operations.

The images below show the EP operation:

* The output on J-Link RTT Viewer:

* The device enumeration:

![usb_mass_storage](images/PID_VID_Composite_PMSC.jpg "Mass Storage device")

![usb_composite_image](images/PID_VID_Composite_PCDC.jpg "CDC device")

* The output on Tera Term:

* Write and read operations:

![write_and_read_operations](images/write_and_read_operations.jpg "Write and read operations log")

* If the user runs the EP on a PC with full permissions, the USB disk will be recognized, and the user will be able to perform any file operations:

* USB disconnect and reconnect behaviour:

![usb_disconnect_and_reconnect_behaviour](images/usb_disconnect_and_reconnect_behaviour.jpg "USB disconnect and reconnect behaviour")

* Note: If the user runs the example project on a PC with full permissions, they need to close Tera Term and eject the USB disk before removing the peripheral USB cable.

## Special Topics ##
### Developing Descriptor ###
Refer **Descriptor** section of [usb_composite_descriptor](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b___c_o_m_p_o_s_i_t_e.html) for developing a descriptor. We can take template file of required usb combination from mentioned path in above link and use the same in source folder by removing the .template file extension.

### Pipe Selection ###
* For Bulk In/Out transfers, USB Pipe 1 to USB Pipe 5 can be used for both usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc operations. The ability of a Pipe to support a USB transfer can be found in the MCU Group User's Manual: Hardware.  
    **Note :** XML configurator will throw an error when same pipes are selected for usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc. Hence it is recommended to select different pipes for usb_pcdc and usb_pmsc.
* For Interrupt, USB Pipe 6 to USB Pipe 9 can be used for usb_pcdc operation.

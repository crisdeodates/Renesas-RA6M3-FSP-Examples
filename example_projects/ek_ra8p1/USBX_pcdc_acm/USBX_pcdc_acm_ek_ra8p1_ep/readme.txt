1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Device CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on
	Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. The user will use an RA board as a CDC device which will be enumerated as a COM
	port when connected to the host PC. Once the board is connected, the user can provide input from the serial
	terminal. The user input will be echoed on the serial terminal. The application status messages will be
	displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Software Requirements:
	Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 6.0.0
	e2 studio: Version 2025-04.1
	SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.44a
	LLVM Embedded Toolchain for ARM: Version 18.1.3
	Terminal Console Application: Tera Term or a similar application
	Windows 10 operating system
	USB Serial Drivers (Included in Windows 10)

3. Hardware Requirements:
   	Supported RA boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, 
			     MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	2 x Type-C USB device cables.
	1 x PC with at least 2 USB ports (1 for debug and 1 for COM port).

6. Verifying Operation: 
	To run this example project, the user needs to compile and download the example project to the evaluation kit,
   	and then follow instructions below to observe the operation of the system.
   	a) On the host PC, open "Device Manager". Expand "Ports (COM & LPT)", locate "USB Serial Device (COMxx)" 
           and note down the COM port number for reference in the next step.
   	b) Open the serial port of the device using Tera Term. When prompted, select the Serial option and choose the
	   COM port number noted in the above step.
   	c) Open the J-Link RTT Viewer to view the application status messages.

Note:
1) Need to update src code as below if the user changes USB Speed in rm_usbx_pcdc_descriptor.c file
   	For High Speed:
	Comment USB_DT_CONFIGURATION, uncomment USB_DT_OTHER_SPEED_CONF in g_device_framework_full_speed[DEVICE_FRAME_LENGTH_FULL_SPEED]
	Uncomment USB_DT_CONFIGURATION, comment USB_DT_OTHER_SPEED_CONF in g_device_framework_hi_speed[DEVICE_FRAME_LENGTH_HI_SPEED]

   	For Full Speed:
	Uncomment USB_DT_CONFIGURATION, comment USB_DT_OTHER_SPEED_CONF in g_device_framework_full_speed[DEVICE_FRAME_LENGTH_FULL_SPEED]
	Comment USB_DT_CONFIGURATION, uncomment USB_DT_OTHER_SPEED_CONF in g_device_framework_hi_speed[DEVICE_FRAME_LENGTH_HI_SPEED]

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000650
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR:  	Not Available

3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

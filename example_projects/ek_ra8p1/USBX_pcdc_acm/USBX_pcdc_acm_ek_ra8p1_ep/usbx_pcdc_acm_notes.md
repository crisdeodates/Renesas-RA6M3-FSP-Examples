# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Device CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. The user will use an RA board as a CDC device which will be enumerated as a COM port when connected to the host PC. Once the board is connected, the user can provide input from the serial terminal. The user input will be echoed on the serial terminal. The application status messages will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Verifying Operation ##
Import, Build and Debug the EP (see section Starting Development of FSP User Manual). After running the EP, open J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output status of the EP.
Open any serial terminal (preferably Tera Term) for providing the user input to view the echoed data.

**Note:** To view the echoed data, **local echo** in serial terminal should be enabled. The user can enable it through [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].

1. The output on **J-Link RTT Viewer**:  
 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/rtt_log.jpg "RTT output")

2. The sample output on **Serial Terminal**:  
 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/serial_terminal.jpg "Serial Terminal output")
 
3. The device enumeration in **Device Manager**. The user can update the Vendor ID and Product ID of their own devices in descriptor file:  
 ![usb_pcdc_acm](images/usbx_pcdc_pid_vid_snapshot.jpg "Device Manager")

## Special Topics ##
### Developing Descriptor ###
1. Refer the **Descriptor** section in [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take a template file of required USB combination from the mentioned path in above link and use the same in the source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

### User Callback Handlers ###
1. **usbx_status_callback()** which handles the USB Attached and Removed events.
2. **ux_cdc_device0_instance_activate()** and **ux_cdc_device0_instance_deactivate()** which handles the device stack enumeration events.

### USBX_PCDC Example Project Limitations ###
1. Limitation in **ZLP**: When the data transfer is an exact multiple of MaxPacketSize (requested_length), **ZLP handler** should be added after the USB Write call to indicate the end of transfer.

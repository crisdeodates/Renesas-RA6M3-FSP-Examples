1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USBX Host Human Interface Device module on
	Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. A wired keyboard or mouse will be enumerated by
	the RA MCU, which is configured as USBX HHID. Upon connecting the keyboard or the mouse, the user can
	press a key on the keyboard, move and press the mouse. The keyboard character, mouse coordinates (x and y),
	mouse button pressed (left, right), error and information messages will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1,
                             EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	1 x OTG cable.
	1 x Wired USB keyboard (e.g., HP PN: 803181-001).
	1 x Wired USB mouse (When using USBX HHID, please use wired device).

3. Hardware Connections:
    	For EK-RA6M5, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 (Full-Speed):
        	Jumper J12 placement is pins 1-2.
        	Remove Jumper J15 pins.
        	Connect a wired USB keyboard/mouse to J11 connector with help of OTG cable.

    	For MCK-RA8T1 (Full-Speed):
        	Jumper JP9 placement is pins 1-2.
        	Remove Jumper JP10 pins.
        	Connect a wired USB keyboard/mouse to CN14 connector with help of OTG cable.

	For EK-RA4L1 (Full-Speed):
		Turn OFF S4-4 to select USB Host mode.
		Set J17 jumper to pins 2-3, Set J7 jumper to use P407 for USBFS VBUS.
        	Connect a wired USB keyboard/mouse to J11 connector with help of OTG cable.

	For EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1 (Full-Speed):
        	Connect a wired USB keyboard/mouse to J11 connector with help of OTG cable.

Note: 
1) The EP does not support High Speed as USBX HHID does not support it.

2) The EP has been confirmed to work properly with the HP brand keyboard (e.g., HP PN: 803181-001), while some other
   keyboard models may not be compatible.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220006b0
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR:  	Not Available

4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

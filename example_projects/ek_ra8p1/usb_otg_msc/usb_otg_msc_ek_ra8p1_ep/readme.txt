1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the USB OTG (On-The-Go) functionality of the RA MCU, showcasing its ability to
	dynamically switch between USB host and device roles. The project will perform various USB operations using the
	USB basic driver. The RA board switches roles depending on the type of USB cable connected (standard or OTG).

	In USB Device Mode, the RA board acts as a USB Mass Storage Class (MSC) device using an SD card as block media.
	When connected to a PC via a USB micro cable, the RA board enumerates as a USB storage device. The PC recognizes
	the board as external storage, allowing file management operations such as reading and writing data directly on 
	the PC.

	In USB Host Mode, the RA board operates as a USB MSC host when a USB OTG cable is connected to its USB port along
	with USB flash drive. In this setup, the RA board manages connected USB storage devices (e.g., USB flash drive)
	as peripheral. In this mode, the SD card and USB storage device function as separate file systems. The application
	also supports file system operations such as listing directories, creating files, and copying files between devices.

	The terminal displays real-time updates of USB operations and system status. The available operations include:
		- Listing directories and files on USB or SD media.
		- Formatting USB disk or SD media.
		- Creating files on USB disk or SD media.
		- Copying files between USB disk and SD media.

	Note:
		- Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via
		  J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults
		  to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer. If supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
		- To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please refer to the instructions
		  provided in the "Special Topic" section of usb_otg_msc_notes.md.
		- RA boards that support J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8P1.

5. Verifying Operation:
	a. Import the project into e2studio, generate project content, build, and flash the firmware onto the RA board 
	   using a Type-C USB cable.
	   Note: Make sure all hardware connections and settings in the "Hardware Connections" section are complete before
		 proceeding.
	b. Open a terminal application (e.g., Tera Term or J-Link RTT Viewer) on the host PC and connect to the RA board’s
	   debug port. 
	   Note: For using the serial terminal:
		- Please ensure that the connection to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer has been terminated.
		- The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits,
		  no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.   
	c. Switch USB Modes: Refer to the "Switching USB Modes" section to configure the board in Device Mode or Host Mode.  
	d. Verify USB Device Mode:
		- The RA board enumerates as a USB MSC device, and the PC recognizes it as external storage.
		- The file system of the SD card should be displayed, and users can perform read/write operations using the PC.
		Note: The user should use the host PC with full access permissions to perform any file operations on the disk
		      (e.g., create, write, read, open, delete).
	e. Verify USB Host Mode:
		- The RA board manages the connected USB storage device and the SD card.
		- Use the terminal menu to:
			- List directories and files on USB and SD media.
			- Format USB and SD media.
			- Create and write files.
			- Copy files between the USB storage device and SD card.

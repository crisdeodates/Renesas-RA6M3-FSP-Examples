# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the USBX Peripheral Printer driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. An RA MCU board will be connected to the PC where the RA board will act as a peripheral printer and the PC (Windows System) will act as a host device. A print command for a test file will be sent from the host PC, and printing data will be transferred from the host PC to MCU. The RA MCU will display Windows machine printer information, settings, and print data on the J-Link RTT Viewer. Error and info messages will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

## Verifying operation ##
If the USB speed configuration needs to be changed, import the EP and perform necessary changes in the project configuration. Please see the **Module Configuration Notes** section for more details. Furthermore, the following updates are needed in the example project.  
**Note:** The EP is set to support USB High Speed by default.

  **For High Speed USB:** 
    
	Uncomment the macro HIGH_SPEED_CONFIG in usbx_pprn_ep.h 
	
  **For Full Speed USB:**
  
    Comment the macro HIGH_SPEED_CONFIG in usbx_pprn_ep.h
    
1. Generate, build, and download the USBX PPRN project to the RA board.  
2. Check the printer device status in Device Manager or in Windows settings.  
    Below images show the device enumeration of the printer in device manager and in Windows settings respectively:  
    ![usbx_pprn_device_printer](images/usbx_pprn_device_printer.png "USBX_PPRN_Printer")

    ![usbx_pprn_device_printer_settings](images/usbx_pprn_device_printer_settings.png "USBX_PPRN_Printer in Windows Settings")

3. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the initialization status.
    Below images show the output on J-Link RTT Viewer:  
    ![usbx_pprn_rtt_output](images/usbx_pprn_rtt_log_1.png "USBX PPRN EP Info and Initialization")

    ![usbx_pprn_rtt_output](images/usbx_pprn_rtt_log_2.png "USBX PPRN Device Initialization")

4. Once the USB initialization is complete, open any file (txt, docx, pdf, xlsx (Text Only)) to print the file using Generic / Text Only printer. After opening, give the print command or press *Ctrl+P* on the keyboard. This will invoke the print window.  
5. Select the **Generic / Text Only** device as the printer, and click on Print, as shown in the below image:

## Special Topics ##
**Developing Descriptor**: A USB device provides information about itself in data structures called USB descriptors. 	

The host obtains descriptors from an attached device by sending various standard control requests to the default endpoint. Those requests specify the type of descriptor to retrieve. In response to such requests, the device sends descriptors that include information about the device, its configurations, interfaces, and the related endpoints.

* Refer **Descriptor** section in [Device Class (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take the template file (**rm_usbx_pcdc_descriptor.c.template**) of the required USB combination from **ra/fsp/src/rm_usbx_port** folder and use the same in the source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the USBX Peripheral Printer driver on Renesas RA MCUs
	based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. An RA MCU board will be connected to the PC where the RA board will
	act as a peripheral printer and the PC (Windows System) will act as a host device. A print command for a test
	file will be sent from the host PC, and printing data will be transferred from the host PC to MCU. The RA MCU
	will display Windows machine printer information, settings, and print data on the J-Link RTT Viewer. Error and
	info messages will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2,
			     EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	2 x Type-C USB cables.
	1 x Host PC with at least 2 USB ports.

3. Configuration Settings:
	To select USB Speed in configuration:
    	i.  Full-Speed: (For EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2,
                         EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1)
            USB Speed                     :    Full Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP0 Port

        ii. High-Speed: (For EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8P1)
            USB Speed                     :    Hi Speed
            USB Module Number             :    USB_IP1 Port

4. Hardware Connections:
	The user needs to confirm the default USB speed selection used in the example project prior to set up
	the hardware connection.

		- Connect the RA board USB debug port (J10) to the PC via a Type-C USB cable for EP debugging.

5. Verifying Operation:
	Following is the sequence used by the application:
	a) Connect the RA board (Peripheral Printer) to host PC via two USB Cables: One for USB Debug port 
           and one for USB HS or FS port.
	b) In Device Manager, printer should be detected as "Generic / Text Only" under Print queues section.
	c) On the Host PC, select any text file or print Test page from the printer properties and execute print command.
	d) MCU will receive the print command and start printing the data.
	e) The printer settings and printing data will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

Note:
1) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000590
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available

2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

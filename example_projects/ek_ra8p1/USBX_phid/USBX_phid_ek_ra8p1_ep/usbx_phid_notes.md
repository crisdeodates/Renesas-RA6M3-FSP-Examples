# Introduction #
This project demonstrates basic functionality of USBX Peripheral Human Interface Device Class module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. The user will be able to use RA board as a keyboard (HID Device) by connecting it to the Host PC. Once the board is connected, the user can provide any input from RTT Viewer to send characters from a - z & numbers 0 - 9 from RA board to host PC. USB status and any error messages are displayed on RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

**Common Configuration Properties**  
|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
| :-------------------------------------: | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------: |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > PHID Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Common > Timer> Timer Ticks Per Second |100 | 1000 | The default ticks should be 1000 indicating 1 tick per millisecond. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > PHID Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Priority | 1 | 21 | PHID thread priority is lowered to allow the other usb operations at faster rate. |
| configuration.xml > Stacks > RTT Thread > Properties > Settings > Property > Thread > Priority | 1 | 22 | RTT thread priority is lowered to allow the USBX PHID data process at the fastest rate possible. |

## Verifying operation ##

Import, Build and Debug the EP (see section Starting Development of FSP User Manual). After running the EP, open the J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output status of EP.

1. The output on **J-Link RTT Viewer**.

 ![usbx_phid](images/rtt_viewer_banner_page.jpg "RTT Output")
 
2. Keyboard keys were printed on the Notepad.

 ![usbx_phid](images/notepad_page.jpg "Keyboard keys on Notepad")
 
3. The device enumeration in Device Manager. The user can update the Vendor ID and Product ID of their own devices in descriptor file.

 ![usbx_phid](images/descriptor_code.jpg "Descriptor")

### Special Topics 
#### Developing Descriptor
1. Refer **Descriptors** section in [USBX Porting Layer (rm_usbx_port)](https://renesas.github.io/fsp/group___u_s_b_x.html) for developing the descriptor. We can take the template file of required usb combination from mentioned path in above link and use the same in source folder by removing the **.template** file extension.

#### User Callback Handlers
1. **usbx_status_callback()** which handle the USB Attached and Removed events.
2. **ux_hid_device_instance_activate()** and **ux_hid_device_instance_deactivate()** which handles the device stack enumeration events.

#### USBX PHID Example Project Limitations
1. USBX PHID module does not support High Speed mode.
2. This example project does not support the out transfer.

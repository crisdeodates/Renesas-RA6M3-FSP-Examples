1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the basic functionalities of the GLCDC device driver on Renesas RA MCUs
	based on Renesas FSP. On successful initialization of the GLCDC module, the EP will read the display resolution
	and frame buffer set in the GLCDC module and draw color bands to cover the entire screen of external LCD
	connected to RA MCU. The user can view raw image in e2studio IDE. Errors and status information will be printed
	on J-Link RTT Viewer during the execution of the project.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1
	1 x Renesas RA Board.
	1 x Graphics Expansion Board:
		For EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA8D1: Graphics Expansion Board (P/N: RTK7EK6M3B00001BU).
		For EK-RA8E2: Graphics Expansion Board (P/N: RTKAPPLCDPS02001BE).
		For EK-RA8P1: Graphics Expansion Board (P/N: RTKLCDPAR1S00001BE).
	1 x Type-C USB cable.
	For EK-RA8D1: 1 x Renesas APP-LCD-CONV1 board or Jumper wires used to connect Graphics Expansion Board to the
                      RA board.

3. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA6M3G:
		- Connect Graphics Expandsion Board to J1, please refer to section 8.1 in EK-RA6M3G - User Manual 
		  https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/mat/ek-ra6m3g-v1-users-manual?r=1168091
		- Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA6M3G to the PC using a micro USB cable.
	
	For EK-RA8D1: 
		- Set the configuration switches (SW1) as below to avoid potential failures.
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		| SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		|     OFF     |     OFF     |      OFF     |     OFF    |     OFF    |     ON     |     ON      |    OFF    |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		
		- If the user uses Renesas APP-LCD-CONV1 board:
			Connect Graphics Expandsion Board to APP-LCD-CONV1.
			Connect APP-LCD-CONV1 Board to J57.
			Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA8D1 to the PC using a micro USB cable.
		
		- If the user does not have Renesas APP-LCD-CONV1 board:
			The user can use Jumper wires to connect Graphic Expansion Board to EK-RA8D1 board manually, 
			please refer "Hardware Connection" section in glcdc_notes.md to connect correctly.
			Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA8D1 to the PC using a micro USB cable.
	For EK-RA8E2:
		- Connect J1 on Graphics Expandsion Board to J1 on EK-RA8E2. Please carefully align pin 2 on the Graphic
                  Expansion Board with pin 1 on the EK-RA8E2.
		- Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA8E2 to the PC using a Type-C USB cable.

	For EK-RA8P1:
		- Connect J1 on Graphics Expandsion Board to J1 on EK-RA8P1. Please carefully align pin 1 on the Graphic
		  Expansion Board with pin 1 on the EK-RA8P1.
		- Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA8P1 to the PC using a Type-C USB cable.

Note: 
1) The user can also view the "Raw Image" in memory monitor of the e2studio IDE using the address of g_framebuffer 
   and specifying the resolution.
   For detailed information, please refer to the "Verifying Operation" section in glcdc_notes.md.
   
2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000850
   b. Keil:	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
   
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

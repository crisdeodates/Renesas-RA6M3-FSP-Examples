1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USB PMSC driver with FreeRTOS on Renesas RA MCUs
	based on Renesas FSP. FreeRTOS uses the underlying Block Media driver. The PMSC driver internally configures
	memory device (SD Card or on board QSPI/OSPI Flash) to pop up as a memory drive on host PC. Error and info
	messages will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

	For EK-RA4L1:
	Since this board does not support the SD/MMC Host Interface (SDHI), the PMSC driver internally configures memory
	device (on board QSPI Flash) to pop up as a memory drive on host PC.

	For EK-RA8E2:
	Since this board does not support the SD/MMC Host Interface (SDHI), the PMSC driver internally configures memory
	device (on board OSPI Flash) to pop up as a memory drive on host PC.

Note:
1) For RA board using external storage (SD Card):
   a. By default, USB PMSC Example Project runs in High-Speed mode (if supported) and uses SDHI in 1-bit bus width mode.
   b. Connect Pmod: use short wiring connections (should be shorter than 10cm).
   c. Regarding the power supply pin: By default, users can use Pmod SD GND (J1:5) and Pmod SD VCC (J1:6) as shown in
      the "Hardware Connections" section, or alternatively, Pmod SD GND (J1:11) and Pmod SD VCC (J1:12).
   d. Format the SD Card before performing any operation.

2) For EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2: Before performing any file system operations, the user must format the USB drive using a
   Host PC with full permissions by following these steps:
   - A pop-up window will appear with the message:
     "You need to format the disk in drive "X": before you can use it. Do you want to format it?", the user need to
     click the "Format disk" button to choose the Format option.
   - In Format option, setting as below:
   	+ File system: FAT (Default).
	+ Allocation unit size: 16 kilobytes.
	+ Volume label: Setting name of USB drive (Optional).
	+ Format options: Enable Quick Format.
   - After finished above settings, click the "Start" button to start format process.
   - Click the "Yes" button to confirm.
   - Once the format process is finished, the user can access to USB drive and perform any file system operations.

3) The user should use the host PC with full access permissions to perform any file operations on the disk
   (e.g., create, write, read, open, delete).

4) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000670
   b. Keil: 	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
5) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

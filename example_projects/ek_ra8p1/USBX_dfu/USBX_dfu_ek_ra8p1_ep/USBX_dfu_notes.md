# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a USBX Device Firmware Update (DFU) driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. The RA MCU board will be connected to the host PC, where it acts as a peripheral device. Prepare a file (.txt,.srec,.xml,.hex, etc.) to download to the RA MCU which has both CDC and DFU interfaces. In a real-world application, a new device firmware can be downloaded. In this example project, a set of data is used to demonstrate the download functionality.

The DFU example application works in four steps:

a. First, the system is initialized with support of the Interface Association Descriptor. The CDC and DFU classes are then initialized with separate interfaces.

b. Secondly, the device mounts as a CDC class and an application on the host (Windows PC) will exercise the DFU class and send a download request. Upon reception of this command, the system un-initializes the CDC class and initializes the DFU class.

c. Then, the device will disappear from the bus for a short time (enough for the host and the device to detect a reset sequence). Upon restarting, the device will be exclusively in DFU mode, downloading the data sent from the host.

d. Finally, when the new data has been downloaded, the host application resets the device, and upon re-enumeration, the device will revert to its normal operation with the new firmware. The RA MCU will display the USB enumeration status on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

## Verifying Operation ##

Import the EP and perform necessary changes in the project configuration. Please see the “Module Configuration Notes” section for more details.

Note:
* This EP supports **only USB Full Speed mode**.
* **Two USB devices will be enumerated** when using this application.
* Before proceeding, the user must **confirm whether the drivers for both devices are installed**:
   Open **Device Manager** → **View** → **Show hidden devices**, and check that the following entries appear under Universal Serial Bus devices:
   - **CDC USB Demonstration**
   - **DFU USB Demonstration**

   ![Device_Manager](images/Device_Manager.jpg "CDC USB Demonstration and DFU USB Demonstration driver installed")

* In case the host PC does not have drivers installed for any of the devices mentioned above, the user needs to perform the steps in the **Driver Installation Procedure** section to run this EP.

### The following procedure describes how to download new data and reset the MCU:

1. On the host PC, prepare a file in format of .txt, .srec, .xml, .hex, etc. to download to the MCU.

2. Connect RA MCU board to the PC as mentioned in **Hardware Connections** section.

3. Generate Project Content, build and download the USBX DFU project to the RA board.

4. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the initialization status.

   ![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_1.jpg "USBX DFU EP Info and Initialization")
	
   ![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_2.jpg "USBX DFU EP Info and Initialization")

5. Run the command **.\dfu-util -d 0000:0002 -D data.txt** to download data.txt file to the MCU.

   ![usbx_dfu_cmd_output](images/USBX_DFU_cmd_output.jpg "USBX DFU command prompt output")

   **Note:** 
   - By default, the CDC USB Demonstration enumerates in Device Manager with Vendor ID: 0000 & Product ID: 0002, the **-d 0000:0002** argument must be used in the command above to ensure data.txt is download to the MCU.  

   ![usbx_cdc_Hardware_Ids](images/USBX_CDC_Hardware_Ids.jpg "USBX CDC Hardware Ids")

   - If you modify the Vendor ID or Product ID in the *rm_usbx_dfu_descriptor.c*, you must also update the command accordingly:
   **.\dfu-util -d `<VendorID>`:`<ProductID>` -D data.txt**
	
6. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the Output status.

   ![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_3.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
   ![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_4.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")

   ![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_6.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
   Run until the maximum number of bytes has been written, as specified by the prepared file:

## Driver Installation Procedure ##
Before installing drivers, the user needs to perform the following steps:

1. Connect RA MCU board to the PC as mentioned in Hardware Connections section.

2. Generate Project Content, build and download the USBX DFU project to the RA board.

### A. CDC USB Demonstration Driver Installation ###

1. Launch the **Zadig** application on the host PC.

2. In Zadig, go to **Options → List All Devices**.

   ![Zadig Device List](images/Zadig_1.jpg "Showing all devices in Zadig")
   
   **Note:** There are 2 COM ports of the same name in the Zadig application, i.e., **CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 0)** and **CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 2)**.  
   The USB device driver installed in interface 0 is a COM port. No changes should be made to this.

3. Select **CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 2)**.
   
   Install driver for CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 2):

   ![usbx_dfu_driver_interface_2_installation](images/Zadig_2.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Interface 2 Installation")

   The CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 2) driver is already installed as shown below:

   ![usbx_dfu_driver_interface_2_installation](images/Zadig_3.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Interface 2 Successful Installation")
		
   **Note:** The PC may need to be restarted to finish the driver installation.

### B. DFU USB Demonstration Driver Installation ###

1. Run the command **.\dfu-util -d 0000:0002 -D data.txt** to download data.txt file to the MCU. This also switches the device from CDC class to DFU class.  
   An error will occur on the Command Prompt — this is expected behavior because the driver is not yet installed.
   
   ![usbx_dfu_cmd_output](images/USBX_DFU_cmd_output_failed.jpg "USBX DFU command prompt output")

   **Note:** Do not reset, disconnect, or power off the board after this step.  
   The device is now operating under the DFU class, and any interruption may cause it to revert back to CDC class before the driver is installed.

2. Launch Zadig and Select **DFU USB Demonstration**
   
   Install the driver for DFU USB Demonstration:
   
   ![usbx_dfu_driver_installation](images/Zadig_4.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Installation")

   The DFU USB Demonstration driver is already installed as shown below:

   ![usbx_dfu_driver_installation](images/Zadig_5.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Successful Installation")

   **Note:** The user need to reset the board after this step.

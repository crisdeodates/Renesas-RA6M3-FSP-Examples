1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of the Port Output Enable for GPT (POEG) driver on Renesas
 	RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. The user can disable the GPT output pins using one of the following options:
	1. Disable GPT output pins based on the GTETRG input pin level.
	2. Disable GPT output pins by software API.
	3. Disable GPT output pins when GTIOC pins are at the same logic level.
	4. Disable GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) crossing events.
	5. Reset the POEG status.
	Information, guideline and error messages are displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer. LED1 is turned ON when the GPT 
	output pin is disabled successfully. LED1 is turned OFF when POEG reset successfully. Additionally, the user can
	verify the EP operation using a logic analyzer.

	Note: EK-RA4L1 board does not support disabling GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) crossing events.

	The user can refer the "Verifying Operation" section to run the example project properly.

5. Verifying Operation:
	To run this example project, follow below instructions to observe the EP operation:
	
	1. Import, Generate and Build the example project.

	2. Connect the USB debug port on the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

	3. Download/Debug the example project to the RA board.

	4. Run the project and open J-Link RTT Viewer to see the output status.

	5. To disable GPT output pins based on the GTETRG input pin level, enter "1": The POEG1 channel number 
	   corresponds to the GTETRG input pin which is used with this channel. GTETRG pin level (active LOW
	   or active HIGH based on configuration) disables GPT output pins on the input level.
	   - After selecting Option 1, refer to the guideline on RTT Viewer or "Hardware Connection" section
	     to connect hardware properly. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".
	   - Remove connection of GTETRG pin and reset of application are needed prior to repeatedly selecting
	     menu option "1", or selecting other options from the menu (except option "5")
	   
	6. To disable GPT output pins by software API, enter "2": The GPT output pins are disabled on 
	   R_POEG_OutputDisable() software API. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".

	7. To disable GPT output pins when GTIOC pins are at the same logic level, enter "3": The GPT output pins
	   are disabled when the GTIOC pins are on the same level. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering
	   Menu option "5".
	
	8. Before running menu option "4", refer to "Hardware Connections" section to connect hardware correctly.
 	   To disable GPT output pins based on comparator (ACMPHS) crossing events, enter "4": The GPT output pins
	   are disabled on comparator crossing events. Then reset the respective POEG status by entering Menu option "5".
	   - Reset of the application is needed prior to repeatedly selecting menu option "4" or selecting other menu
	     options (except option "5") to restart DAC0, DAC1, and ACMPHS.
	   - For FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA8E2:
	     a. Internal Reference Voltage (Vref) is used as reference voltage source and AN000 is used as input voltage
	        source for ACMPHS module, which is supplied by output of DAC0. The user can enter DAC0 value within
	        permitted range to provide an analog signal input for AN000. Reset of the application is needed prior 
	        to repeatedly selecting menu option "4" or selecting other menu options (except option "5") to restart
		DAC0 and ACMPHS.
	     b. Internal Reference Voltage (Vref) is used as reference voltage source, it is set to 1.18V (Equivalent to
	        a digital value 1465).
	     c. The user has to input DAC0 value in between (0 - 1400) or (1600 - 4095) to prevent voltage fluctuations
	        caused by electrical noise, which may affect the comparator output.
	
	9. To reset POEG channel 0 (Required after running option 3): enter "5", then enter "1".
	   To reset POEG channel 1 (Required after running options 1, 2, or 4): enter "5", then enter "2".
	
	10. Verify the POEG operation through output status on RTT Viewer, LED behavior or
	    waveform on a Logic Analyzer (optional).

Note:
1) To verify the EP operation waveform with a Logic Analyzer, see the 'Special Topics' section in the poeg_notes.md file.

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000450
   b. Keil:     Not Available
   c. IAR:      Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

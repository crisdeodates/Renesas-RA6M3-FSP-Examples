1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ELC HAL module APIs.
        ELC Software Event, GPT4 and GPT0 events are linked using ELC. The start source for GPT4 and GPT0 is ELC Software Event and
        the stop source for GPT4 is GPT0 counter overflow. GPT4 runs in PWM mode and GPT0 runs in one-shot mode.
        On giving valid J-Link RTT Viewer input, an ELC Software Event is generated that triggers LED blinking.
        LED stops blinking after 5 seconds when GPT0 expires.
		
	For FPB-RA0E1:
	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ELC HAL module APIs.
	ELC Software Event, TAU0 and TAU1 events are linked using ELC. The start source for TAU1 is ELC Software Event and
	the start source for TAU0 is end of counter TAU1. TAU0 runs in one-shot pulse output and TAU1 runs in delay counter mode.
	On giving valid RTT Viewer input, an ELC software Event is generated that turn on LED1 after 1 seconds.
	LED1 turn on for 2 seconds until request pulse width has expires.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	Jumper wire.

Note:
1) The user is expected to enter data of size not exceeding 15 bytes.

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22040040
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

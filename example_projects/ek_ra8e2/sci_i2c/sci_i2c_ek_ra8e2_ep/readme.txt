1. Project Overview:
	This Example Project demonstrates SCI_I2C Master operation through loop-back with IIC Slave driver.
	6 bytes of data will be transmitted and received continuously on successful initialization. 
	The transmitted data is compared with the received data. If the data matches, on-board LED starts blinking.
	On a data mismatch, LED stays ON. Failure messages and status is displayed on RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Connections:
	Jumper wires are required to establish loop back connection along IIC lines within the board with pins as
	mentioned below:

   FPB-RA4E1, FPB-RA2E3, MCK-RA8T1, EK-RA2A2, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2 external pull up resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7k ohms are 
   required to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.

2) For EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 value of external pull up resistors is 1.0k ohms.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22040040
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available

4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

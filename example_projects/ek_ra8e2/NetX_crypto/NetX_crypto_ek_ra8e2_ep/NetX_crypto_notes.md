# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of NetX Secure Crypto on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP supporting SCE7/SCE9/RSIP-E51A/RSIP-E11A/RSIP-E50D/RSIP-E31A hardware acceleration using AzureRTOS. The example project executes AES, ECC, RSA algorithms (including different chaining modes) in multi-threaded environment using mutex to enable access to SCE/RSIP. The user can enter any key to enable concurrent execution of the different algorithms and status of the execution will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the NetX Crypto example project, the following resources are needed.

* Refer to the software required section in [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)
* Refer to [Special Topics](#special-topics) for more information of NetX Crypto setup.

### Hardware ###
* Supported RA Boards:
  * SCE7      - EK-RA6M2
  * SCE9      - EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5
  * RSIP-E51A - EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA8E2
  * RSIP-E11A - EK-RA4L1
  * RSIP-E50D - EK-RA8P1, MCK-RA8T2, EK-RA8M2
  * RSIP-E31A - EK-RA4C1
* 1 x Renesas RA board.
* 1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
* 1 x Host PC.

### Hardware Connections ###
* Connect the USB Debug port on the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

* For EK-RA4C1:  
	* The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3 and turn OFF SW4-4 to use the on-board debug functionality.

* For EK-RA8M2:
	* The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3, and J29 on pins 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 to use the on-board debug functionality.

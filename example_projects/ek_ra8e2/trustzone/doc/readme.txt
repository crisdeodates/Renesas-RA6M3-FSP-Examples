1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the DOC HAL module APIs. The project performs the different 
        event operations selected by the user in configurator properties. Events can be selected viz., Compare Match, 
        Compare Mismatch, Addition Overflow, Subtraction Underflow. Upon Success/Failure of operation, the result will
        be displayed on RTT Viewer. LED will turn ON only if the selected event operation is success and stays OFF if
	the operation fails.

2. Software Requirements:
	Refer to the Tools section in the Release Notes for set up suitable Software version.
	https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.

Note:ï»¿
1) The user should view "Example Project for IP Protection" section of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run
   a trustzone project via link: https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/security-design-arm-trustzone-using-cortex-m33

2) The user should refer to the "RASC User Guide for MDK and IAR" section for instructions on using RASC for IAR and Keil
   via link: https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html#RASC-MDK-IAR-user-guide

3) For the IAR project, the user can launch the workspace using the .eww file in the non-secure project folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

4) For the KEIL project, the user can launch the workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

5) The user must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.

6) After the projects are built successfully, the user should follow these steps in sequence to launch the debug session:
   - Open Renesas Device Partition Manager (In e2studio or RASC -> Run -> Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device Partition
     Manager), then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
   - Initialize device. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Setting up Hardware" section of the R11AN0467 to 
     perform the action.
   - Set Trustzone secure / non-secure boundaries. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Download and Debug the
     Application Projects" section of the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Launch the Debug session from the non-secure project.

7) For IAR project, the user can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack -> Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not
   valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch. 

8) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x32042430
   b. Keil:	0x32042830
   c. IAR: 0x3204288c
 
9) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

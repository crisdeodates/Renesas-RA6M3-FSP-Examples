1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB PHID driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
	The project configures RA board as a Keyboard. On pressing any key from J-Link RTT Viewer, MCU sends characters
	from a - z & numbers 0 - 9 to the host PC.

2. Software Requirements:
	Refer to the Tools section in the Release Notes for set up suitable Software version.
	https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA6E2, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1,
			     EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	2 x Type-C USB cables.
	1 x PC with at least 2 USB ports (1 for debug and 1 for COM port).
	
4. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 (Full Speed):
		- Jumper J12 placement is pins 2-3.
	  	- Connect jumper J15 pins.
	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB device cable to micro-AB USB Full Speed 
	          port (J11) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the 
	          host PC. 

	For EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2 (Full Speed):
 	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB cable to micro-AB USB Full Speed
	          port (J11) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the
	          host PC.

	For MCK-RA8T1 (Full Speed):
	  	- Jumper JP9 placement is pins 2-3.
	  	- Connect jumper JP10 pins.
	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB device cable to Type-C USB Full Speed 
	  	  port (CN14) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the 
	 	  host PC.

	For EK-RA4L1 (Full Speed):
		- Turn ON S4-4 to select USB device mode.
		- Set J17 jumper to pins 2-3, Set J7 jumper to use P407 for USBFS VBUS.
		- Connect the RA board USB FS port (J11) to the PC via Type-C USB cable.
		- Connect the RA board USB debug port (J10) to the PC via Type-C USB cable for EP debugging.

	For EK-RA8E2 (Full Speed):
		- Connect the RA board USB FS port (J11) to the PC via Type-C USB cable.
		- Connect the RA board USB debug port (J10) to the PC via Type-C USB cable for EP debugging.

Note:
1) Open Device Manager, and check 'Human Interface Devices', to see 'USB Input Device' has been detected.

2) Lowercase a - z and numbers 0 - 9 are send from MCU to the host PC.ï»¿

3) The user should view "Example Project for IP Protection" section of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run
   a trustzone project via link: https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/security-design-arm-trustzone-using-cortex-m33

4) The user should refer to the "RASC User Guide for MDK and IAR" section for instructions on using RASC for IAR and Keil
   via link: https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html#RASC-MDK-IAR-user-guide

5) For the IAR project, the user can launch the workspace using the .eww file in the non-secure project folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

6) For the KEIL project, the user can launch the workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

7) The user must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.

8) After the projects are built successfully, the user should follow these steps in sequence to launch the debug session:
   - Open Renesas Device Partition Manager (In e2studio or RASC -> Run -> Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device Partition
     Manager), then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
   - Initialize device. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Setting up Hardware" section of the R11AN0467 to 
     perform the action.
   - Set Trustzone secure / non-secure boundaries. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Download and Debug the
     Application Projects" section of the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Launch the Debug session from the non-secure project.

9) For IAR project, the user can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack -> Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not
   valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch.

10) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x320425b0
   b. Keil:	0x320435b0
   c. IAR: 0x32046eec
 
11) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
    in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

**********************************************************************************************************************/

1. Project Overview:
	This Example Project demonstrates the functionality of AGT in periodic mode and one-shot mode. On providing any
	input on the RTT Viewer, AGT channel 0 starts in one-shot mode. AGT channel 1 starts in periodic mode when AGT
	channel 0 expires. Timer in periodic mode expires periodically at a time period specified by the user and toggles
	the on-board LED.

2. Software Requirements:
	Refer to the Tools section in the Release Notes for set up suitable Software version.
	https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.

Note:
1) The user is expected to enter data not exceeding 15 bytes in size.
   Operation is not guaranteed for any user input value other than integer, char (i.e. float, special char) through RTT.

2) The user should select "Input -> Sending -> Send on Enter" for RTT View configuration.

3) The user should view "Example Project for IP Protection" section of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run
   a trustzone project via link: https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/security-design-arm-trustzone-using-cortex-m33

4) The user should refer to the "RASC User Guide for MDK and IAR" section for instructions on using RASC for IAR and Keil
   via link: https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html#RASC-MDK-IAR-user-guide

5) For the IAR project, the user can launch the workspace using the .eww file in the non-secure project folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

6) For the KEIL project, the user can launch the workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

7) The user must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.

8) After the projects are built successfully, the user should follow these steps in sequence to launch the debug session:
   - Open Renesas Device Partition Manager (In e2studio or RASC -> Run -> Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device Partition
     Manager), then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
   - Initialize device. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Setting up Hardware" section of the R11AN0467 to 
     perform the action.
   - Set Trustzone secure / non-secure boundaries. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in "Download and Debug the
     Application Projects" section of the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Launch the Debug session from the non-secure project.

9) For IAR project, the user can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack -> Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not
   valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch.

10) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x32042450
   b. Keil:	0x32042850
   c. IAR: 0x320428c4
 
11) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
    in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

1. Project Overview:
    	This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USBX Device Mass Storage Class module on Renesas
    	RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. RA Board will act as a device MSC peripheral. The USBX PMSC
    	driver internally configures memory device (block media with sdmmc or block media SPI flash) to enumerate as
	a memory drive on host PC. The user can read, write and perform various file operations on the disk.
    	The system initialization status and any errors will be printed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

	For EK-RA4L1:
	Since this board does not support the SD/MMC Host Interface (SDHI), the PMSC driver internally configures memory
	device (on board QSPI Flash) to pop up as a memory drive on host PC.

	For EK-RA8E2:
	Since this board does not support the SD/MMC Host Interface (SDHI), the PMSC driver internally configures memory
	device (on board OSPI Flash) to pop up as a memory drive on host PC.

Note:
1) For RA board using external storage (SD Card):
   a. Connect PMOD: use short wiring connections (should be shorter than 10cm).
   b. Regarding the power supply pin: By default, Users can use PMOD SD Pin5 (GND) and PMOD SD Pin6 (VCC) as shown in the
      "Hardware Connections" section, or alternatively, PMOD SD Pin11 (GND) and PMOD SD Pin12 (VCC).
   c. Format the SD Card before performing any operation.

2) For EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2: Before performing any file system operations, the user must format the USB drive using a
   Host PC with full permissions by following these steps:
   - A pop-up window will appear with the message:
     "You need to format the disk in drive "X": before you can use it. Do you want to format it?", the user need to
     click the "Format disk" button to choose the Format option.
   - In Format option, setting as below:
   	+ File system: FAT (Default).
	+ Allocation unit size: 16 kilobytes.
	+ Volume label: Setting name of USB drive (Optional).
	+ Format options: Enable Quick Format.
   - After finished above settings, click the "Start" button to start format process.
   - Click the "Yes" button to confirm.
   - Once the format process is finished, the user can access to USB drive and perform any file system operations.

3) The user should use the host PC with full access permissions to perform any file operations on the disk
   (e.g., create, write, read, open, delete).

4) In case of changing USB mode (Full speed or High speed), for detailed configuration please refer to
   "Module Configuration Notes" section in USBX_pmsc_notes.md file.

5) Note that under rare situations, the user might need to run the EP in standalone mode for the drive to enumerate successfully.

6) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22040220
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
7) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

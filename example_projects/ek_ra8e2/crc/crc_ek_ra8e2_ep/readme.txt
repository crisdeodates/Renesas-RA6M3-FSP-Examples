1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the CRC HAL module APIs.
        The project demonstrates CRC operation for data transmission in normal mode and reception in snoop mode through SCI interface.
	If board not support snoop mode (EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2, MCK-RA4T1, MCK-RA6T3, EK-RA4L1) reception in normal mode through SCI interface.
	If board not support snoop mode (FPB-RA0E1) reception in normal mode through SAU interface.
        On Pressing any key through RTT Viewer CRC value in normal mode is calculated for 4 bytes of data.
        The calculated CRC value along with input data is transmitted and received on SCI_UART (except for FPB-RA0E1 support SAU_UART) 
	through loop-back. Once the transfer is complete, and if CRC value for snoop mode is zero and transmit and receive buffer 
	are equal then On-board LED blinks as sign of successful CRC operation. On data mismatch, LED stays ON. Failure and status 
	messages are displayed on RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Connections:

Note:
1) For any event or API failure appropriate messages is displayed on RTT Viewer.

2) The user can change the polynomial to CRC_16 and CRC_CCITT and bit order from MSB to LSB from CRC configurator and observe the results
   (For FPB-RA0E1 only supports CRC_CCITT and LSB).

3) The application does not work for CRC_32 bit polynomial.

4) Please refer the latest FSP User Manual for comparison with popular online CRC calculator and the associated limitations 
   are captured in it.

5) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22040450
   b. Keil:     Not Available 
   c. IAR:      Not Available 

6) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of mbed crypto driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
    	The EP performs following mbed crypto operations:
	1. AES256 Key generation (for GCM Mode), Encryption and Decryption.
    	2. SHA256 - setup and calculate hash, compare calculated hash value and length with their expected values.
    	3. ECC - P256R1 Key pair generation, Signing the hashed message with private key & verify hashed message with public key.
    	4. RSA 2048 Key pair generation, Signing the hashed message with private key & verify hashed message with public key.
    	On successful completion of each operation, success message will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.
    	Error and info messages will be printed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

	Note:
	1) EK-RA2L1, EK-RA4M1 and EK-RA4W1 boards do not support SHA, ECC, and RSA operations.
	2) EK-RA4L1 board does not support RSA operation.
	3) Some MCUs support hardware crypto operations, some MCUs support software crypto operations. 
           Refer to configuration.xml -> Stacks -> MbedTLS (Crypto Only) -> Properties -> Settings -> Property ->
	   Common -> Hardware Acceleration configuration for the specific configurations for each example project.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA2L1, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4W1, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G
			     EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, RSSK-RA6T1, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1,
			     EK-RA8E2
	1 x Renesas RA board.	
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.

3. Hardware Connections:
	Connect the USB Debug port on the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

Note:
1) Initialize device back to factory default by using Renesas Device Partition Manager before run the example project.
   The user can refer Section 5.3 "Setting up Hardware" in the document via link:
   https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-ra-security-design-arm-trustzone-ip-protection
   For Renesas Device Partition Manager tool on each IDE:
   - Start E2Studio -> Run -> Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device Partition Manager (Available on e2studio)

2) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22044550
   b. Keil:  	Not Available
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

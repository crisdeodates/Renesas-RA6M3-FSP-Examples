1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USBX Peripheral Audio device driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on
	Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. RA MCU will be connected as USBX peripheral audio to the host PC. An audio WAV file will 
	be played on the host PC using audio player (example Audacity). The WAV audio data will be transferred from host PC to the 
	MCU using the isochronous OUT, through USBX PAUD module. Once the audio data is received on the MCU, the received audio 
	data will be stored on the MCU SRAM. When the host PC starts recording audio using the audio recorder (example Audacity), 
	the MCU will send the audio data stored in the MCU SRAM to the host PC using the isochronous IN, through USBX PAUD module. 
	The user will be able to play, listen and verify the recorded audio file data. USBX status and any errors will be printed 
	on the J-Link RTT Viewer which will be handled in separate thread.

	   	Verify "USB Audio Demonstration" appears.
	   Expand Audio inputs and outputs
	   	Verify "Headphones (USB Audio Demonstration)" and "Microphone (USB Audio Demonstration)" appears.

	3. Open the J-Link RTT Viewer to view the application status messages.
	
Note: Due to limited RAM, EK-RA4L1 cannot support the default Host Interface MME, which requires a minimum audio buffer of 100ms.
      Please change the Host Interface to Windows WASAPI (requires a minimum audio buffer of 10ms) in all Audacity windows. 
      For detail, please refer to the usbx_paud_notes.md.

	4. Play an audio file (eg. .wav, .mp3) using an audio player (example Audacity) on host PC.

	5. MCU records the audio received in SRAM upon reception of the audio data from PC.

	6. After audio play is completed , start recording audio using audio recorder (example Audacity) on the host PC.

	7. MCU sends the received data back to PC upon request from PC.

	8. Export the recorded data to a desired format (eg. .wav, .mp3).

	9. Import the exported recorded audio into audio player (example Audacity).

	10. Listen to the recorded audio and verify. The playback and recorded audio should be similar. There can be
	    differences if the recorded format differs or a partial record is acquired.

Note:
1) Need to update src code as below if the user changes USB Speed:
   For High Speed: Uncomment the macro APL_AUDIO_20 in usbx_paud_ep.h file
   For Full Speed: Comment the macro APL_AUDIO_20 in usbx_paud_ep.h file

1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB PHID driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
	The project configures RA board as a Keyboard. On pressing any key from J-Link RTT Viewer, MCU sends the host PC 
	characters from a - z & numbers 0 - 9.

2. Software Requirements:
	Refer to the Tools section in the Release Notes for set up suitable Software version.
	https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA6E2, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, MCK-RA8T1,
			     EK-RA4L1
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	2 x Type-C USB cables.
	1 x PC with at least 2 USB ports (1 for debug and 1 for COM port).
	
4. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA6M4, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1 (Full Speed):
		- Jumper J12 placement is pins 2-3.
	  	- Connect jumper J15 pins.
	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB device cable to micro-AB USB Full Speed 
	          port (J11) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the 
	          host PC. 

	For EK-RA4E2, EK-RA6E2 (Full Speed):
 	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB cable to micro-AB USB Full Speed
	          port (J11) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the
	          host PC.

	For MCK-RA8T1 (Full Speed):
	  	- Jumper JP9 placement is pins 2-3.
	  	- Connect jumper JP10 pins.
	  	- Connect the micro USB end of the micro USB device cable to Type-C USB Full Speed 
	  	  port (CN14) of the board. Connect the other end of this cable to USB port of the 
	 	  host PC.

	For EK-RA4L1 (Full Speed):
		- Turn ON S4-4 to select USB device mode.
		- Set J17 jumper to pins 2-3, Set J7 jumper to use P407 for USBFS VBUS.
		- Connect the RA board USB FS port (J11) to the PC via Type-C USB cable.
		- Connect the RA board USB debug port (J10) to the PC via Type-C USB cable for EP debugging.

Note:
1) Open Device Manager, and check 'Human Interface Devices', to see ' USB Input Device' has been detected.

2) Lower case a - z and numbers 0 - 9 is send from MCU to the host PC.ï»¿

3) The user should view section 5 of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run a trustzone project.
   https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/apn/renesas-ra-security-design-arm-trustzone-ip-protection

4) For the IAR project, the user can launch the Workspace using the .eww workspace file in the non-secure project folder. 
   It included multiple workspace which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

5) For the KEIL project, the user can launch the Workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder. It included multiple workspace 
   which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) project.

6) The user must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.

7) After the projects are built successfully, the user should follow these steps in sequence to launch the debug session:
   - Open Renesas Device Partition Manager, then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
   - Initialize device back to factory default. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Set Trustzone secure / non-secure boundaries. Refer to the corresponding screen shots in the R11AN0467 to perform the action.
   - Launch the Debug session from the non-secure project.

8) For IAR project, The user can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack -> Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not
   valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch. 

9) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x200025b4
   b. Keil:	0x20002168
   c. IAR: 	0x20005c30
 
10) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
    in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

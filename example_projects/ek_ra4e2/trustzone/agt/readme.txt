1. Project Overview:
	This Example Project demonstrates the functionality of AGT in periodic mode and one-shot mode.  On providing any 
input on the RTTviewer, AGT channel 0 starts in one-shot mode. AGT channel 1 starts in periodic mode when AGT channel 0 expires.
Timer in periodic mode expires periodically at a time period specified by user and toggles the on-board LED.
	
NOTE:
1. User is expected to enter data of size not exceeding above 15 bytes.
   Operation is not guaranteed for any user input value other than integer,char(i.e. float, special char) through RTT.




1) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x200024a4
   b. Keil:	0x2000200c
   c. IAR: 0x20002074
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

1. Project Overview:
	This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of USB Peripheral Vendor class driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
	In this example, the application will configure the MCU as a Vendor Peripheral device. This Peripheral device will be connected to
	the USB Host Vendor device which is another RA board. After the enumeration is completed, the Vendor Peripheral board will read 
	15 Bytes of data from the Vendor Host board and write back the same data to the Vendor Host board. The Vendor Host and Vendor 
	Peripheral applications are designed to continuously transfer data between both the boards. User will be able to see all the 
	operation sequence and status on JLink RTTViewer.

2. Supported Boards:
	EK-RA2A1, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA4E2

3. Hardware Requirements:
    	External Hardware : USB OTG cable   - 1 nos
                            USB Cable	    - 3 nos
	EK-RA2A1, EK-RA4M1, EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5, EK-RA4E2 - Running USB PVND Example Project 
	Any RA board running USB HVND Example Project

4. Configuration changes to switch Speed in configurator:

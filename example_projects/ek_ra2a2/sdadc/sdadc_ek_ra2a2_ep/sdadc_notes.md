# Introduction #

This Example project demonstrates the basic functionalities of SDADC running on Renesas RA MCUs using RA board. The SDADC channel 0 and channel 2 is connected as differential ended input mode. Data read from both the channels is displayed on JLink RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage | Searchable Keyword  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| SDADC | The SDADC module is used to convert an analog input signal to digital values at 24-bit resolution with a preamplifier. | r_sdadc_b |


## API Usage ##
The table below lists the FSP provided API used at the application layer by this example project.

| API Name    | Usage                                                                          |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R_SDADC_B_Open | This API is used to apply power and initialize the SDADC_B module based on the user configuration. |
| R_SDADC_B_ScanCfg | This API is used to configure the enabled channels of the SDADC. |
| R_SDADC_B_ScanStart | This API is used to start converting analog input signals to digital values. |
| R_SDADC_B_StatusGet | This API is used to retrieve the status of the SDADC module. |
| R_SDADC_B_Read32 | This API is used to read the most recent conversion result from a channel. |
| R_SDADC_B_Close | This API is used to remove power and de-initialize the SDADC_B module based on the user configuration. |

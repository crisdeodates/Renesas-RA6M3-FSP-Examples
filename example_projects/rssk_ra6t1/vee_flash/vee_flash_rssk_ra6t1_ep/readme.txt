Project Overview:
    This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of vee flash driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
    Based on User input, EP performs following operations :
    1. Writing different data types to the different record IDs of vee flash.
    2. Reading back the data from the different record IDs.
    3. Format operation.
    4. Get the status of Virtual EEPROM.
    5. Refresh operation.   

    On successful completion of each operation, success message will be displayed on the Jlink RTTViewer.
    Error and info messages will be printed on JlinkRTTViewer.


1) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x1ffe0a0c
   b. Keil: Not Available
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

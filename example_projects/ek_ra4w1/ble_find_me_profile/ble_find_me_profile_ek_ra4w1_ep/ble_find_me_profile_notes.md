# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of an RA4 MCU operating as a BLE Server board establish connection with Renesas browser installed on the device client. 
An RA MCU using freeRTOS and the Renesas FSP was used to create this example project. This EP "find me profile" is configured to establish the connection with the Renesas GATTBrowser 
installed on the client device. Led 1 on the server board will provide visual feedback to indicate once the client has established connection or when a disconnection occurs. LED1 is 
turned on when the connection is established. It will turn off if the client is disconnected. The user can send alert levels, connect requests, or disconnect requests from the Renesas 
GATTBrowser on the client device. LED0 blink speed is used to indicate which user alert level is selected. If user chooses alert level 0, the LED0 does not blink. If user chooses alert 
level 1, LED0 blinks slower compared with if use chooses alert level 2. The connection status and LEDs status messages will display on Jlink RTT viewer.

Note: Download GATTbrowser app for IOS (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gattbrowser/id1163057977)

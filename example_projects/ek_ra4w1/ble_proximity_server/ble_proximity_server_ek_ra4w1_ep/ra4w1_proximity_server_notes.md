# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of an RA4 MCU operating as a BLE Proximity Profile Server by establishing a connection 
with Renesas browser installed on the device client. This EP "ra4w1_proximity_server" is configured to establish the connection with the 
Renesas GATTBrowser installed on the client device. LED1 on the server board will provide visual feedback to indicate once the client has 
established connection or when a disconnection occurs. LED1 is turned on when the connection is established. It will turn off if the client 
is disconnected. The user can send alert levels, connect requests, or disconnect requests from the Renesas GATT Browser on the client device. 
LED0 blink speed is used to indicate which user alert level value is changed. If user chooses alert level 0, the LED0 does not blink(it 
remains lighted). If user chooses alert level 1, then LED0 blinks slow. If the user chooses alert level 2. then LED0 blinks fast. LED0 Alert 
levels set for both operation of Immediate Alert Level and Link Loss Alert Level. The user also can read and test Tx_power level (tps) and 
test Receive Signal Strength Indicated (RSSI). The connection status and LEDs status messages will display on Jlink RTT viewer.

![ra4w1_proximity_server](images/GATTBrowser2.jpg "ra4w1_proximity_server GATTBrowser") 

From the Device with Renesas GATT Browser installed. Connect the device with RA4W1_SRV and send the requests.
Including 
1. "Connect, Disconnect"
2. Write without response Immediate Alert Level = 0, 1 or 2.
3. Write and Read back Link Loss Alert Levels = 0, 1 or 2. (User needs to write first then read back)
4. Read Tx Power and RSSI ((click the connect button first, then click the read button to read the Tx Power and RSSI values, next click the disconnect button to close the connection).).

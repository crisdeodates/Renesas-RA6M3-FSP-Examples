1. Project Overview:

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of an RA4 MCU operating as a BLE Server by establishing a connection with Renesas 
browser installed on the device client. An RA MCU using freeRTOS and the Renesas FSP was used to create this example project. This 
EP "ra4w1_proximity_server" is configured to establish the connection with the Renesas GATTBrowser installed on the client device. Led1 
on the server board will provide visual feedback to indicate once the client has established connection or when a disconnection 
occurs. LED1 is turned on when the connection is established. It will turn off if the client is disconnected. The user can send 
alert levels, connect requests, or disconnect requests from the Renesas GATT Browser on the client device. LED0 blink speed is used 
to indicate which user alert level value is changed. If user chooses alert level 0, the LED0 does not blink(it remains lighted). If user 
chooses alert level 1, then LED0 blinks slow. If the user chooses alert level 2. then LED0 blinks fast. LED0 Alert levels set for both 
operation of Immediate Alert Level and Link Loss Alert Level. The user also can read and test Tx_power level (TPS) and test Receive Signal 
Strength Indicated (RSSI). The connection status and LEDs status messages will display on Jlink RTT viewer.

2. Software Requirements:
	Device client (iphone or ipad,..v.v.) has Renesas GATT browser installed.
	Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 5.8.0
	e2 studio: Version 2025-01
	SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer: Version 8.12c
	GCC ARM Embedded Toolchain: Version 13.2.1.arm-13-7


3. Hardware Requirement:

	i. 1x micro usb cable.
        ii. 1x board of EK-RA4W1.
        iii. 1x mobile device with Renesas GATT Browser installed.

4. Hardware Connections:
 	Supported Board EK_RA4W1:		
	i. Connect RA board to Host machine using micro usb cable.

Note: After running EP "ra4w1_proximity_server". The User must use Renesas GATT browser to search and connect to Local Name "RA4W1_SRV" 
	  displayed on your device RA4W1_SRV. Use Write without response "Immediate Alert Level" to set Immediate Alert Level. The User can 
	  Write and Read "Link Loss Level", Read TX Power and RSSI from your device GATTBrowser and the messages will be shown on RTT Viewer.

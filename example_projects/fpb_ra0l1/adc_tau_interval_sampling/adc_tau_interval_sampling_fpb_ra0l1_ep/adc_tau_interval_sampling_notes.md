# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of an ADC TAU Interval Sampling using the ADC, DTC, TAU, and ELC peripheral on a RA MCU. ADC TAU Interval sampling allows users to sample analog signals at periodic intervals with a double buffer. The frequency of sampling is determined by the settings of the TAU linked to the ADC unit by the ELC. The DTC is used to transfer data from the ADC data registers to the circular buffer. Using the DTC allows the CPU to be used for other operations. When the first buffer is filled completely, the CPU executes the ADC Interrupt service routine to switch to the DTC to fill the second buffer with ADC values, Raise a flag/event to allow processing on the data available in the first buffer. Such functionality is popular for Data signal acquisition applications that require a continuous sampling of Analog signals.

## Verifying Operation ##
### Setting up waveform rendering ###
* To set waveform rendering, the user needs to first debug the code, then go to memory view and add g_user buffer under memory monitor.
* The user can view any of the respective channel by adding specific ADC Unit buffer under memory monitor. For example ADC Unit 0 Group A Channel 0 samples can be viewed by selecting &g_buffer_adc[0][0][0].
  This way other ADC Units, groups, and channels can be selected. 
* Then click on New Rendering -> Waveform -> Waveform properties
* The configuration parameters of the Waveform properties are as follows:
  - Select Data Size: 16bit
  - User-specified: Tick on the box
  - Minimum values: 0
  - Maximum values: 4095
  - Channel: Mono
  - Buffer size: 512

**Note:** 12-bit ADC will have minimum and maximum value between 0-4095. As Ping-Pong buffer is used, the buffer size is 512 (i.e., 256*2) for each channel, where 2 denotes the number of buffers and 256 is the size of the buffer. The user can add the buffer address of each channel in the memory to view the waveform of each channel connected.

![Setting_Waveform_Properties](images/setting_waveform_properties.jpg "Set the waveform properties") 

### Input for Signal generator ###
* The signal needs to be generated from the Signal Generator for the Input to the ADC (0-3V Sinusoidal) with a frequency set to 800Hz.

Import, build and debug the EP (*see section Starting Development* of **FSP User Manual**). After running the EP, open waveform rendering in memory viewer to see the output
of sampled data. One can also check the buffer in real-time by adding it to the expression tab. 

Click Real-time Refresh on Memory monitor tab to check buffer in real-time:

![Real_time_setting](images/real_time_setting.jpg "Real-time Refresh")

The images below showcase the output on waveform rendering of ADC for each channel of group:
* ADC Group channel 0 (g_buffer_adc[0][0][0]):

![ADC_Periodic_output](images/ADC0_Group_channel0.jpg "Waveform Rendering of ADC Group, Channel 0 Output")

* ADC Group channel 1 (g_buffer_adc[0][0][1]):

 ![ADC_Periodic_output](images/ADC0_Group_channel1.jpg "Waveform Rendering of ADC Group, Channel 1 Output")

## Special Topics ##
### Setting up Chain Mode in DTC ###
* The chain mode can be set up by declaring local transfer info structure containing info related to Chain Mode Transfer and configure DTC with the same info.
  The table below lists the transfer info elements required for chain transfer
  | Transfer info element | transfer info 0 | transfer info 1 |
  |-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | Transfer mode | Normal mode | Normal mode |
  | Source address control | Fixed | Fixed |
  | Destination address control | Incremented| Incremented |
  | Chain transfer | Enabled | Disable |
  | Transfer block size | 2 bytes | 2 bytes|
  | Transfer source address | R_ADDR0 | &R_ADDR1 |
  | Transfer destination address | g_buffer[unit 0][Group scan][channel 0][0][0] | g_buffer[unit 0][Group scan][channel 1][0][0] |
  
**Note:** Above table shows chain transfer for group of ADC Unit 0 same way this can be updated for other ADC units and group. The user can also update their info as per requirement
* After A/D conversion is completed, the DTC is activated by an A/D Scan complete interrupt request.
  Once the DTC is activated, it reads transfer info for transfer_adc_group[0] which is a local buffer, and copy values of register ADDR0
  to the destination buffer location of DTC g_buffer_adc[0]. Since chain transfer is enabled, so the DTC successively reads transfer_adc_group[1](i.e channel 1 of ADC unit 0 group).
* Once DTC operation for transfer_adc_group[1] starts it transfers values of registers ADDR1 to the destination buffer g_buffer_adc[1]. Since chain transfer is disabled in transfer info of A[1],
  data transfer by the DTC is completed here.

### Calculating Time period and ADC Trigger Raw count ###
* To calculate the Time period of TAU timer use:
  * Time period = 1/input frequency (where input sampling frequency is 2 * signal generator input frequency).
  * This calculated Time Period can be set as the TAU Time period in the properties tab.
* To calculate Raw period count for ADC trigger, use:
  * Raw period count = (Time period in seconds * (ICLK / (2^ pre_scaler))) 
    * (where pre_scaler value is 0 by default, so 2^0 = 1)
  * **Note :**  ICLK frequency will vary depending on the MCU variant.

### Ping Pong Buffer Operation ###
* The DTC is used to transfer data from the ADC data registers to the Ping-Pong buffer.
* Using the DTC allows the CPU to be used for other operations.
* When the first buffer is filled completely(i.e., desired sample size), a DTC activation source generates an interrupt to the CPU.
* The CPU executes the ADC Interrupt service routine to:
* Switch to the DTC to fill the second buffer with ADC values, and allow processing on the data available in the first buffer.

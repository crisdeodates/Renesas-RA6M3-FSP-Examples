1. Project Overview:
	The example project showcases how the TML driver operates on Renesas RA MCUs. The demonstration includes
	showcasing the TML timer with counter operation, capture operation in normal mode, and counter operation
	in low power mode. In TML counter operation (normal mode), three TML instances (which are configuredÂ as 8-bit,
	16-bit, and 32-bit counter modes) operate for the input duration by the user. In TML 16-bit capture operation,
	user can trigger an ELC software event to get the raw counts value of 16-bit timer. In TML counter operation
	(low power modes), the 32-bit timer is configured as counter mode with input period time. Once the 32-bit timer
	has expired, the RA board is woken up from LPM to normal mode. The EP information and error messages will be
	printed to the Host PC.

	Note: 
		- To display information, users can select between the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer and
		  the Serial Terminal (UART) with J-Link OB VCOM.
		- By default, EP information is printed to the host PC via the Serial Terminal.
		- To utilize the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please follow the instructions
		  in tml_notes.md file.
		- RA boards support J-Link OB VCOM: FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2, FPB-RA0L1.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA Boards: FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0E2, FPB-RA0L1
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable.
	1 x Host PC.

3. Hardware Connections:
	Connect the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

	For FPB-RA0E1:
	---------
		To use J-Link OB VCOM for Serial Terminal (UART):
			- The soldering bridge E4 must be closed.
			- Populate R10 with a resistor ranging from 0 to 150 ohms.

	For FPB-RA0E2:
	---------
		To use J-Link OB VCOM for Serial Terminal (UART), the user must close E46, E47.

	For FPB-RA0L1:
	---------
		To use J-Link OB VCOM for Serial Terminal (UART), the user must close E28, E29.
		To use the on-board debug functionality, the user must place jumper J9 on pins 1-2.

Note:
1) For using the Serial Terminal (UART):
	a) To echo back what was typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through:
	   [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].
	b) The serial terminal setting parameters are as follows:
		Select the COM port provided by the J-Link on-board.
		Baud rate: 115200 bps
		Data length: 8-bits
		Parity: none
		Stop bit: 1-bit
		Flow control: none

2) For using the J-Link RTT Viewer:
   If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

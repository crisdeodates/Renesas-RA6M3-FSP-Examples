# Introduction #
This example project demonstrates the basic usage of SAU SPI driver in master configuration on Renesas RA MCUs. The project writes commands to the slave digital thermometer module, and reads the temperature values using SAU SPI bus configured as master. The temperature values are continuously printed on terminal. Status information and error messages will be printed on terminal during the execution of the project.

**Note:**
* Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer. If supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
* To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please refer to the instructions provided in the Special Topic.
* In addition to communicating with the digital thermometer module, the example project can also communicate with the sau_spi_slave EP. For more information, please refer to the document of the sau_spi_slave EP.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the example project.
2. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are completed.
3. Open serial terminal application on the host PC (Tera Term) and connect to the COM Port provided by the J-Link onboard or open J-Link RTT Viewer (In case user selected SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer).
   * Note: For using the serial terminal:
        * Please ensure that the connection to the J-Link RTT Viewer has been terminated if it was previously established.
        * The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.
        * To show the degree Celsius symbol (Â°C), the user needs to select the "Consolas" font through: [Setup] -> [Font...] -> [Font:]
4. Flash or debug the example project.
5. Open the terminal application and view output log.

## Special Topic ##
**Special notes:**
* Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer; if supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
  * To configure display options:
    * **For UART via J-Link OB VCOM**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1`
    * **For J-Link RTT Viewer**: Define `USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0`
  * It is important to note that the user should only operate a single terminal application (SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART)) at a time to avoid conflicts or data inconsistencies. 
  * The board supports J-Link OB VCOM: FPB-RA0E1, FPB-RA0L1.

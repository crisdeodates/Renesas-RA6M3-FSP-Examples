# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the operation of USBX Host UVC Module running on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using AzureRTOS. 
The USB camera will be connected as a peripheral device to the RA board which will act as a host device. A user menu will be provided over the RTT Viewer. The User can select option 1 to start video streaming and select option 2 to stop video streaming.
After stopping the video streaming, the last captured image can be displayed on the e2studio's memory window. Error and info messages will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

## Verifying operation ##
    
1. Import, generate, build, and download the USBX HUVC project to the RA board.
2. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the initialization status.

    Below images show the output on J-Link RTT Viewer:

![usbx_huvc_rtt_output](images/usbx_huvc_rtt_log_1.jpg "USBX HUVC EP Info and Initialization")

3. Once the USB initialization is complete, The User enters '1' to start the streaming video and then enters '2' to stop the video channel and capture a JPEG image.

![usbx_huvc_rtt_output](images/usbx_huvc_rtt_log_2.jpg "USBX HUVC Device Initialization")

4. After stopping the video channel, the last captured image can be displayed via the memory window view on e2studio.

a) Click [Windows] â†’ [Show View] â†’ [Memory] to open the Memory view.

![Open_memory_view](images/open_memory.png "Open memory view")

b) In "Memory Monitor" pane, click icon ![icon_add_memory](images/icon_add_memory.jpg "Add memory monitor") to add monitor: "fb_data.p_pointer" and click [OK] to proceed.

![Add_image_buffer](images/add_pointer.png "Add image buffer ")

c) Click "New Renderingsâ€¦" in Memory Rendering pane. Select "Image" and click "Add Rendering(s)" to 
display JPEG images. Only if a JPEG file header is found at the given memory address, e2studio will decode the image to be shown.

d) Click icon ![icon_realtime_refresh](images/icon_refresh_time.jpg "Real-time refresh") to enable the "Real-time Refresh"

![Add_image](images/add_image.png "Add image")

e) Example:

## Special Notes on attach and detach the Camera: ##

* The attach and detach events of the camera are detected by the program.
* If user disconnects the camera while the image is being streamed, user needs to reset the MCU.
* If user disconnects the camera when the image capture is stopped, the application can handle repeated attach and detached operations.

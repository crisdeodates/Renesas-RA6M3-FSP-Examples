1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates the typical use of the ADC HAL module APIs.
        The project initializes the ADC in single scan or continuous scan mode based on user selection in RA configurator.
        Once initialized,user can initiate the ADC scan and also stop the scan (in the case of continuous scan mode)
        using JLinkRTTViewer by sending commands. Result and ADC status is displayed on the JLinkRTTViewer.


2. Hardware settings for the project:
        Supported Boards - EK-RA8M1

        Hardware connections:
        No Hardware connections required

3. Configuration Settings:
        The example project, by default, runs in continuous scan mode on the boards.
        In order to switch the scan mode, change the 'Mode' field of ADC Driver in the RA configurator to Single Scan.

4. Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000450
   b. Keil: Not Available 
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
5. If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

Note:
+ Example project will generate .ihex file as default, it is required to change to .hex file to use with JFlashLite.
+ As information from https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm,
LLVM haven't supported for Exceptions and RTTI for C++. Example project was added -fno-exceptions and -fno-rtti flags.

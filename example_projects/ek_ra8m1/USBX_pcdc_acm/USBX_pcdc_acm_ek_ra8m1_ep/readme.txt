1. Project Overview:
   	This project demonstrates the basic functionality of USBX Device CDC ACM module on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas 
	FSP using AzureRTOS. In this example project, user will use the RA board as a CDC device which will enumerate as a COM 
	port when connected to the host PC. Once the COM port is enabled, user can provide input from the Serial terminal. 
	User input will be echoed on the serial terminal. The application status messages will be displayed on the Jlink RTT Viewer.
 
2. To run this example project, user needs to compile and download the example project to the evaluation kit and then follow 
   below instructions to observe the operation of the system.

   	Supported Boards: EK-RA4M2, EK-RA4M3, EK-RA6M1, EK-RA6M2, EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M4, EK-RA6M5 and EK-RA8M1:

   	1) On the host PC, open Windows Device Manager. Expand Ports (COM & LPT), locate USB Serial Device (COMxx) and note down 
           the COM port number for reference in the next step. 
   
   	2) Open the serial port of the device using tera term.
   
   	3) Open the RTT viewer to view the application status messages.
     
3. Software Requirements:
	Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP): Version 6.0.0
	e2 studio: Version 2025-04.1

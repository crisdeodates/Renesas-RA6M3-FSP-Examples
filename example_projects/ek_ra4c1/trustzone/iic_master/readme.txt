1. Project Overview:
	The example project demonstrates the typical use of the IIC master HAL module APIs.
	The project initializes IIC master module with standard rate and interfaces with Pmod ACL Board for ADXL345.

	On power up after establishing the connection of sensor with RA board, it displays accelerometer axis data on
	J-Link RTT Viewer. Any API/event failure will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

2. Software Requirements:
	Refer to the "Tools" section in the FSP release notes to set up all the required software via the link below:
	https://github.com/renesas/fsp/releases

3. Hardware Requirements:
	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Pmod ACL (https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-acl-3-axis-accelerometer/).
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.
	4 x Jumper wires used to connect the RA board to the Pmod ACL.

4. Hardware Connections:
	Pmod ACL has two on board connectors, J2 is used for I2C communication.

		GND pin   (J4:19) ----> GND (on Pmod ACL)

	For EK-RA4C1:
	--------
		The user must place jumper J6 on pins 2-3, J8 on pins 1-2, J9 on pins 2-3 and turn OFF SW4-4 to use
		the on-board debug functionality.
		SDA1 P401 (J1:4)  ----> SDA (on Pmod ACL)

5. Verifying Operation:
	a) Import and build projects: the user must build secure project (_s) first, then build non-secure (_ns) project.
	b) After the projects are built successfully, the user should follow these steps in sequence to launch the debug
	   session:
		- Open Renesas Device Partition Manager (RDPM): In e2studio or IAR and Keil using RASC -> Run ->
		  Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device Partition Manager, then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
		- Initialize the MCU: On RDPM, select only "Initialize device" option, then click "Run". If successful,
		  go to the next steps.
   		- Set Trustzone secure/ non-secure boundaries: On RDPM, uncheck "Initialize device", select only
		  "Set Trustzone secure/ non-secure boundaries" -> Select "Use Renesas Partition Data file" -> 
		  Use "Browse" to select the .rpd file generated from the secure project (For e2studio: e2studio\secure_project\Debug,
		  for Keil: keil\secure_project\Objects, and for IAR: iar\secure_project\Debug\Exe), then click "Run". If successful,
		  go to the next steps.
		- Only setting used for IAR project: The user can change setting in the Tools -> Option -> Stack ->
		  Uncheck "Stack pointer(s) not valid until program reaches" option to ignore Stack Warning at launch.
   		- Launch the debug session from the non-secure project.
	c) Open J-Link RTT Viewer to view the example project operation.

Note:
1) For the functioning of IIC Master on all the boards except for EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA4L1, EK-RA8E2,
   EK-RA4C1 external pull up resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7K ohms are required to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.ï»¿

2) The user should view "Example Project for IP Protection" section of application note R11AN0467 on how to build and run
   a trustzone project via link: https://www.renesas.com/en/document/apn/security-design-arm-trustzone-using-cortex-m33

3) The user should refer to the "RASC User Guide for MDK and IAR" section for instructions on using RASC for IAR and Keil
   via link: https://renesas.github.io/fsp/_s_t_a_r_t__d_e_v.html#RASC-MDK-IAR-user-guide

4) For the IAR project, the user can launch the workspace using the .eww file in the non-secure project folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

5) For the KEIL project, the user can launch the workspace using the .uvmpw file in keil folder.
   It included multiple workspaces which has both secure (_s) and non-secure (_ns) projects.

6) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x20002e04
   b. Keil:	0x2000283c
   c. IAR:      0x2000288c
 
7) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT)
   in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings, iar\Debug\List).

1. Project Overview:
        The example project demonstrates some of the capabilities of the EK and FSP by using multiple peripherals.
        The project initializes the USB, ADC, SDRAM, OSPI, CEU, MIPI and GPIO modules to create an interactive user demo.

        Once programmed the user can control the board by button presses on the board and see regularly updated board
        configuration on the kit information screen.
        On the attached LCD pannel the user can interact with the application, please read the following document

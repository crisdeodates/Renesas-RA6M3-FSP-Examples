# Introduction #

The example project demonstrates the functionalities of WiFi_OnChip_Silex running on Renesas RA MCUs using Renesas Silex UART Pmod hardware. The project gives user option to either scan WiFi networks or manually enter network credentials in J-Link RTT Viewer and connect. Then it performs a ping operation on user's entered URL or IP address. If successful, 'Ping Successful' message is printed on J-Link RTT Viewer. The project also demonstrates UDP socket operations in client mode. It tries connecting to the user entered UDP server IP address and port number. It is expected that UDP socket in server mode would be running on user PC and listening on a free port before the EP tries to connect. Once connected to the UDP server, the client sends a 'hello' to the server and then waits for the user to send the message from the server. Any incoming message from the server is displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer connected to the client. After receiving messages from the server, appropriate acknowledgment messages are sent to the server. 

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of the operation.

## Required Resources ##
To build and run the example project, the following resources are needed.

### Hardware ###
* 1 x RA board 
* 1 x Renesas Silex UART Pmod module
* 1 x Wi-Fi router Access Point(AP) with internet access. Note: WiFi router AP's credentials should be known.
* 1 x PC or laptop connected to the same Wi-Fi router AP. On PC/laptop, create UDP server and start listening at a port which is free. Port of value greater than 10000 is recommended.
* 1 x Micro USB cable

Refer to [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for information on how to connect the hardware.

### Software ###
1. Refer to the software required section in [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf)

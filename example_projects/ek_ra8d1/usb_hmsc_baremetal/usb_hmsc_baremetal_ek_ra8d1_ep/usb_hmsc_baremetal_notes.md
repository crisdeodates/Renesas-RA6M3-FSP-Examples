# Introduction #

This example project demonstrates basic functionalities of USB Host Mass Storage Class (HMSC) driver with FAT file system with Baremetal
using FreeRTOS+FAT on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. FreeRTOS+FAT uses the blockmedia driver, which uses an underlying USB HMSC driver
to perform file operations on the storage devices. The project performs basic file operations (open, read, write, format and close) on
the USB Flash drive. Error and EP status messages will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer.

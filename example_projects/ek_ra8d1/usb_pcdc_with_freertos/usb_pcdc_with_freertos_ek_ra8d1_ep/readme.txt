1. Project Overview:
        This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the USB PCDC driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using FreeRTOS. 
        In this example, the user will be able to use the RA board as a  CDC to UART converter by connecting through a COM port
        from the host PC. The converter performs the data reception and data transmission asynchronously.
        The user can connect any UART device to receive the data typed in Tera Term, and to send any data to the converter to
        display on Tera Term. The user can also change the baud rate, stop bit and parity bit configuration at run time through
        Tera Term. The status of the application will be displayed on JLink RTT Viewer.

Note:
1. The user can connect any other UART device to communicate with the USB PCDC to UART converter.
2. To enable testing of the converter, the user can also loop back the TX and RX pins on the RA board USB to UART converter.
3. High-speed is supported the default configuration setting in the project for MCUs which support high-speed USB.
   For MCU with full speed USB only, full speed USB will be default configuration setting. For switching from High-speed to full-speed,
   refer instructions in the README.md.

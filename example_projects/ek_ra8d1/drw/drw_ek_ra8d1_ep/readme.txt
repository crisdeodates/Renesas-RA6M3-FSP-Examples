1. Project Overview:
    	The Example Project demonstrates the basic functionalities of DRW device driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP.
	On successful initialization of DRW and GLCDC module, the EP will display the frame buffer set in the GLCDC module and
    	draw various shape and shape fills to cover the entire screen of external LCD connected to RA MCU. Additionally, API 
 	Failure messages will be displayed on RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
   	Renesas RA boards: EK-RA6M3G, EK-RA8D1
    	1 x Micro USB cable.
	For EK-RA6M3G: 1 x Graphics Expansion Board (Included in the kit).
    	For EK-RA8D1: 1 x MIPI Graphics Expansion Board (Included in the kit).

3. Hardware Connections:
	For EK-RA6M3G:
    	  1. Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA6M3G to the PC using a micro USB cable.
    	  2. Connect Graphics Expansion Board to the RA board.

	For EK-RA8D1:
	  1. Connect the USB Debug port on EK-RA8D1 to the PC using a micro USB cable.
	  2. Connect the MIPI Graphics Expansion Board to J58 of EK-RA8D1.
	  3. Set the configuration switches (SW1) on the EK-RA8D1 board as below:
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		| SW1-1 PMOD1 | SW1-2 TRACE | SW1-3 CAMERA | SW1-4 ETHA | SW1-5 ETHB | SW1-6 GLCD | SW1-7 SDRAM | SW1-8 I3C |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+
		|     OFF     |     OFF     |       OFF    |     OFF    |      OFF   |     OFF    |      ON     |    OFF    |
		+-------------+-------------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+-------------+-----------+

Note:  
1) User can also view the "raw image" in memory monitor of the e2studio IDE using the address of g_framebuffer
   and specifying the resolution.
   For EK-RA8D1: Please select format "RGB: 32bpp (8:8:8:8)" to view "raw image" in memory monitor

2) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220008d0
   b. Keil: 	Not Available 
   c. IAR: 	Not Available
 
3) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

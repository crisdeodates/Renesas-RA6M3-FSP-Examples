# Introduction #

The example project showcases how the FileX file system operates on the SDRAM block media of the RA MCU. The project will perform various FileX file system operations based on the user's selection from the menu options, such as media management (format), directory management (create, get properties, delete), and file management (create, write, read, delete). The terminal application is used as the user interface. The menu options and system messages (errors and information messages) will be printed on the terminal application during the execution of the project.

**NOTE:**
- To display information, users can choose between the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer and the Serial Terminal (UART)with J-Link OB VCOM. It is important to note that the user should only operate a single terminal application at a time to avoid conflicts or data inconsistencies. 
- For instructions on how to switch between these options, please refer to the "Verifying Operation" section in this file.
- By default, EP information is printed to the host PC using the Serial Terminal for boards that support J-Link OB VCOM.
 
  Vice versa, for the RA boards that do not support J-Link OB VCOM, EP uses the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer by default instead.
- RA boards supported for J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA8D1

The menu options:
1. Format Media.
2. Create Directory.
3. Get Directory Properties.
4. Delete Directory.
5. Create Empty File.
6. Write To File.
7. Read From File.
8. Delete File.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import the example project. 

    By default, the EP supports Serial terminal for RA boards that support J-link OB VCOM

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

    To use SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer, please follow the instructions below:

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

2. Generate, and build the example project.
3. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are done.
4. Connect the RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable.
5. Open a Serial terminal application on the host PC and connect to the COM Port provided by the J-Link on-board or 
   Open J-Link RTT Viewer (In case the user selected SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or RA boards do not support J-Link OB VCOM).
   * Note: For using the serial terminal:
        * Please ensure that the connection to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer has been terminated.
        * The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.
        * To echo back what was typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].

6. Debug or flash the EP project to the RA board.
7. After the main menu is displayed on the terminal application, the user selects options to perform file system management as desired.
    * Type '1' and enter to format the media.
    * Type '2' and enter to create a new directory.
    * Type '3' and enter to get root directory properties.
    * Type '4' and enter to delete a directory.
    * Type '5' and enter to create an empty file.
    * Type '6' and enter to write a fixed content into a file.
    * Type '7' and enter to read the first 1 KB of content in a file.
    * Type '8' and enter to delete a file.

## Limitation ##
Please note that the current configuration supports the FAT12 and FAT16 formats for media storage in SDRAM. Future updates will enhance compatibility by supporting larger SDRAM capacities and the FAT32 format.

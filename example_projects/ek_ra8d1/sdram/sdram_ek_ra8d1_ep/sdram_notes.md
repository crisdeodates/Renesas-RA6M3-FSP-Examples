# Introduction #
This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of SDRAM on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. The example project writes data to the entire SDRAM using DMAC. It demonstrates SDRAM settings and data retention by enabling self-refresh in low power mode. When the Ultra-Low-Power Timer (ULPT) expires, the MCU returns to normal mode and reads the SDRAM to ensure the data is still retained. The EP status information and error messages are displayed on the host PC. Additionally, the error LED will turn on if an error occurs.

**NOTE:**
- To display information, users can choose between the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer and the Serial Terminal (UART)with J-Link OB VCOM. It is important to note that the user should only operate a single terminal application at a time to avoid conflicts or data inconsistencies. 
- For instructions on how to switch between these options, please refer to the "Verifying Operation" section in this file.
- By default, EP information is printed to the host PC using the Serial Terminal for boards that support J-Link OB VCOM.

  For the RA boards that do not support J-Link OB VCOM, EP uses the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer by default instead.
- RA boards supported for J-Link OB VCOM: EK-RA8D1

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Import the example project. 

    By default, the EP supports Serial terminal for RA boards that support J-link OB VCOM

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=1 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

    To use SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer, please follow the instructions below:

    * Define USE_VIRTUAL_COM=0 macro in Project Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> GNU ARM Cross C Compiler -> Preprocessor

2. Generate, and build the example project.
3. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are completed.
4. Connect the RA MCU debug port to the host PC via a micro USB cable.
5. Open a Serial terminal application on the host PC and connect to the COM Port provided by the J-Link on-board or 
   Open J-Link RTT Viewer (In case the user selected SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or RA boards do not support J-Link OB VCOM).
   * Note: For using the serial terminal:
        * Please ensure that the connection to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer has been terminated.
        * The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.
6. Debug or flash the EP project to the RA board to view output log.

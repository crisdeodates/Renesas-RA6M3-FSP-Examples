# Introduction #

The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a USBX Device Firmware Update (DFU) driver on Renesas 
RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. The RA MCU board will be connected to the host PC, where it acts as 
a peripheral device. Prepare a file (.txt,.srec,.xml,.hex, etc.) to download to the RA MCU which has both CDC and 
DFU interfaces. In a real-world application, a new device firmware can be downloaded. In this example project, a 
set of data is used to demonstrate the download functionality.

The DFU example application works in four steps:

a. The system is initialized with support of the Interface Association Descriptor. The CDC and DFU classes are 
   then initialized with separate interfaces.

b. The device mounts as a CDC class and an application on the host (Windows PC) will exercise the DFU class 
   and send a download request. Upon reception of this command, the system un-initializes the CDC class and initializes 
   the DFU class.

c. Then, the device will disappear from the bus for a short time (enough for the host and the device to detect a reset 
   sequence). Upon restarting, the device will be exclusively in DFU mode, downloading the data sent from the host.

d. Finally, when the new data has been downloaded, the host application resets the device, and upon re-enumeration, 
   the device will revert to its normal operation with the new firmware. The RA MCU will display the USB enumeration 
   status on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

## Verifying operation ##

Import the EP and perform necessary changes in the project configuration. Please see the “Module Configuration Notes” section for more details.

Note: This EP is supported only USB Full speed mode.

The following is the procedure to download new data and reset the MCU:

The steps 5 to 9 only need to be done once.

1. On a Windows machine, prepare a file in format of .txt, .srec, .xml, .hex, etc. to download to the MCU.

2. Connect RA MCU board to the PC as mentioned in readme file.

3. Generate Project Content, build and download the USBX DFU project to the RA board.

4. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the initialization status.

    Below images show the USBX DFU Initialization on J-Link RTT Viewer:

	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_2.jpg "USBX DFU EP Info and Initialization")

5. Launch zadig application on Host PC and install the drivers as shown below:

	**Note: There will be two USB devices enumerated with this application.**
	
	a. In the zadig, choose Options -> List all devices.
	
	![usbx_dfu_zadig_initialization](images/Zadig_1.jpg "USBX DFU Initialization")
		
	b. Check the two USB interfaces that are named CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 0) and (Interface 2).
		
	![usbx_dfu_driver_installation](images/Zadig_2.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Installation")
		
	![usbx_dfu_driver_installation](images/Zadig_3.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Installation")
		
	c. Select **WinUSB driver** to install for the other CDC USB Demonstration interface (interface 2).
	
	**Note:**  
	**+ The USB device driver installed in interface 0 is a COM port. No changes should be made to this.**  
	**+ The PC may need to be restarted to finish the driver installation.**
		
6. Once the driver is installed, open the directory: \dfu-util-0.11-binaries.tar\dfu-util-0.11-binaries\win64.
	
7. Paste the prepared file (e.g. data.txt) in the directory and open command line from this directory.

8. Run command .\dfu-util -D data.txt to download to the MCU. 

9. Again, launch Zadig and install the driver for "DFU USB Demonstration".

	![usbx_dfu_driver_installation](images/Zadig_4.jpg "USBX DFU Driver Installation")

10. Now, run the command .\dfu-util -D data.txt to download to the MCU. 

	![usbx_dfu_cmd_output](images/USBX_DFU_cmd_output.jpg "USBX DFU command prompt output")
	
11. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the Output status.

    Below images show the output on J-Link RTT Viewer:

	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_3.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_4.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_5.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_6.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	Run till the maximum bytes need to be written as per the file prepared:
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_7.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_8.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")
	
	![usbx_dfu_rtt_output](images/USBX_DFU_rtt_9.jpg "USBX DFU EP output")


### Key Notes
1. There are two COM ports of the same name in the Zadig application, i.e., CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 0) and CDC USB Demonstration (Interface 2).
   The USB device driver installed in interface 0 is a COM port. No changes should be made to this.

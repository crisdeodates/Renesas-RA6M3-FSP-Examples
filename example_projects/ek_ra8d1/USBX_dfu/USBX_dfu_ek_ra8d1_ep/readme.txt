1. Project Overview:

	The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a USBX Device Firmware Update (DFU) driver on Renesas 
	RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. The RA MCU board will be connected to the host PC, where it acts as 
	a peripheral device. Prepare a file (.txt,.srec,.xml,.hex, etc.) to download to the RA MCU which has both CDC and 
	DFU interfaces. In a real-world application, a new device firmware can be downloaded. In this example project, a 
	set of data is used to demonstrate the download functionality.

     	The DFU example application works in four steps:

		a. First, the system is initialized with support of the Interface Association Descriptor. The CDC and DFU classes are 
		   then initialized with separate interfaces.

		b. Secondly, the device mounts as a CDC class and an application on the host (Windows PC) will exercise the DFU class 
		   and send a download request. Upon reception of this command, the system un-initializes the CDC class and initializes 
		   the DFU class.

		c. Then, the device will disappear from the bus for a short time (enough for the host and the device to detect a reset 
		   sequence). Upon restarting, the device will be exclusively in DFU mode, downloading the data sent from the host.

		d. Finally, when the new data has been downloaded, the host application resets the device, and upon re-enumeration, 
		   the device will revert to its normal operation with the new firmware. The RA MCU will display the USB enumeration 
		   status on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

	Following is the sequence used by the application.

		a. Connect two USB Cables to the PC : One for USB Debug port and other for USB FS port.
		b. Prepare a  file (e.g. .txt, .hex, .xml, .srec etc) to download to the MCU.
		   Size of file must be smaller than 30KB by default. 
		   In case download file with larger size, please change value of BUFFER_SIZE macro in usbx_cdc_dfu_peri_device_common.h file.
		   The example test file Data.txt (29KB) is included in the EP folder.
		c. Launch Zadig application on Host PC and refer to md file for configuration details.
       		d. Launch the command prompt in dfu_util directory(refer to md file for details) and download the file to the MCU.
       		e. The settings and errors will be displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

Note:

1) Segger RTT block address may needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220090d0
   b. Keil: Not Available 
   c. IAR: Not Available
 
2) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called _SEGGER_RTT) 
   in .map file generated in the build configuration folder (Debug/Release).

1. Project Overview:
	This Example Project demonstrates the functionality of ULPT in periodic mode and one-shot mode. The user selects 
the period for both one-shot and periodic timers as 1 second, 2 seconds, or 3 seconds. After selecting the period, 
the ULPT1 starts in periodic mode and toggles the on-board LED when the ULPT1 underflow interrupt occurs. The ULPT1 
will stop after underflow three times, and the ULPT0 will start in one-shot mode after that. The MCU will be put into 
Deep SW Standby mode and wait for the ULPT0 underflow interrupt to reset the MCU internally to Normal Mode and restart the EP.

3. Supported Boards:
	EK-RA8M1, EK-RA8D1

3. Hardware Requirements:
	Renesas RA boards: EK-RA8D1 boards
	Micro USB cable x 1

4. Hardware Connections:
	Connect the USB Debug port on the RA8 boards to the host PC via a micro USB cable.

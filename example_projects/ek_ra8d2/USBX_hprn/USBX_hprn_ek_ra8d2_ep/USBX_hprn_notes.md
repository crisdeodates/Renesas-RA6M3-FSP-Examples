# Introduction #

This project demonstrates the basic functionality of the USBX Host Printer driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP using Azure RTOS. An RA MCU board will be connected to the PC where the RA board will act as a host device and the printer will act as a peripheral device. A print command for a test page will be sent from the RA board, and printing data will be transferred from the host device to the printer. Printer information and error messages will be displayed on J-Link RTT Viewer.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of the operation.

## Verifying Operation ##

If the USB speed configuration needs to be changed, import the EP and perform necessary changes in the project configuration. Please see the **Module Configuration Notes** section for more details.

**Generate the Printing data array**

The project is developed using a printing array generated for an HP-2130 Deskjet printer. The following is the procedure for generating and converting .pcl/.prn to a hex array for your printer:

1. On a Windows machine, install the required drivers for the printer to be used. Print a test page to make sure the driver works properly.

2. To convert a testing document to .pcl/.prn file, open it using an editor, MS word, etc, and press Ctrl+P or select print from the File menu option.

3. In Printer section, select the connected printer and check the "Print to File" option.

4. Click "Print" and save the file in .pcl/.prn format into the system.

5. Convert the .pcl/.prn file data into hex data using below mentioned link: http://tomeko.net/online_tools/file_to_hex.php?lang=en
	
6. The new hex data obtained from step 5 should be replaced the print_tes_page[] array used in /src/usbx_hprn_entry.c in the example project.

7. Generate, build, and download the USBX_hprn project to the RA board.

8. Connect the printer to the RA MCU board as mentioned in readme file.

9. Check the printer device status, should be ready for printing.

10. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the initialization status.

The image below shows the output on J-Link RTT Viewer:

![usbx_hprn_rtt_output](images/USBX_HPRN_with_printer_rtt_1.jpg "USBX HPRN EP Info and Initialization")

11. Once the USB initialization is complete, it shows the printer device details and asks for a key press, to send the printing data from RA MCU to printer.

12. Once all the data is sent to the printer, it shows the completion status on J-Link RTT Viewer. 

The images below show the printing status on J-Link RTT Viewer and the page printed by an HP-2130 Deskjet printer:

![usbx_hprn_rtt_output_print_status](images/USBX_HPRN_with_printer_rtt_2.jpg "USBX HPRN Print status ")

![usbx_hprn_printer_output](images/USBX_HPRN_with_printer_output.jpg "USBX HPRN Printer output")

**Verify with USBX_pprn EP if compatible printer is not available**

1. Connect two RA boards to host PC via 2 type-C USB cables.

2. Import, build, and download the USBX_hprn project to the first RA board and the USBX_pprn project to the second RA board.

3. Connect the USB cable to the appropriate USB port between the first RA board running USBX_hprn project and the second RA board running USBX_pprn project.

4. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the status on the first RA board. The image below shows the output on J-Link RTT Viewer of USBX_hprn:

![usbx_hprn_rtt_output_initialization](images/USBX_HPRN_rtt_1.jpg "USBX HPRN EP Info and Initialization")

5. Open J-Link RTT Viewer to verify the status on the second RA board. The image below shows the output on J-Link RTT Viewer of USBX_pprn:

![usbx_pprn_rtt_output_initialization](images/USBX_PPRN_rtt_1.jpg "USBX PPRN EP Info and Initialization")

6. Enter any key on the first RA board to print the test page:

![usbx_hprn_rtt_output_print_test_page](images/USBX_HPRN_rtt_2.jpg "USBX HPRN EP print test page")

7. Verify output on J-Link RTT Viewer of USBX_pprn:

![usbx_pprn_rtt_output_verify](images/USBX_PPRN_rtt_2.jpg "USBX PPRN EP verify")

8. Verify output on J-Link RTT Viewer of USBX_hprn:

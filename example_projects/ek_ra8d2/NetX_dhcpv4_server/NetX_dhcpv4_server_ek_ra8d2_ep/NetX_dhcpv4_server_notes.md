# Introduction #
The sample code accompanying this file shows the operation of a NetX Duo DHCPv4 Server on a RA MCU using Azure RTOS. In this sample code, a NetX Duo IP instance is created with IP address as (default 0.0.0.0 - Not assigned). The Server is always configured the IP address, in this EP 192.168.0.2 is the IP address of the Board (DHCP Server). The NetX stack is enabled for UDP, ICMP, ARP. DHCP Server uses the UDP protocol to receive DHCP Client requests and transmit responses. DHCP Server creates its own packet pool based on the settings minimum packet payload size and number of packets in the packet pool. DHCPv4 Server creates a pool of IP addresses from the given range and set network parameters for specified interface.

Once the DHCPv4 Server is running and has created client records and assigned IP addresses, it periodically checks the time remaining on each of the client IP leases. If a lease expires, the server simply removes the client record from the client record table, and returns that IP address back to the pool of assignable IP addresses. No message is sent to the client.

The status messages, clients info, and the code flow informational messages as part of the initialization are displayed on the J-Link RTT Viewer.

**Note :** Range of IP address for clients are from 192.168.0.10 to 192.168.0.20.

NetX Duo DHCPV4 Server is compliant with [RFC2132](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132), [RFC2131](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131), and related RFCs.

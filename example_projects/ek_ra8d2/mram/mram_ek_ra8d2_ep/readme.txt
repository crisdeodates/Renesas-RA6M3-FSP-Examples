1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the basic functionality of the MRAM driver on Renesas RA MCUs using the
	Renesas Flexible Software Package (FSP). The user can interact with the application via RTT input to execute
 	write, read, and erase operations, starting at a fixed MRAM address. The operation status and data content
	are displayed in the RTT Viewer.

2. Hardware Requirements:
	Supported RA boards: EK-RA8P1, EK-RA8D2
 	1 x Renesas RA board.
	1 x Type-C USB cable for programming and debugging.

3. Hardware Connections:
	Connect the USB Debug port on the RA board to the host PC via a Type-C USB cable.

Note:
1) The user is expected to enter data not exceeding 15 bytes in size. Operation is not guaranteed for any user input
   value other than integer (e.g., float, char, special char) through RTT Viewer. Providing any input after selecting
   the EXIT option is invalid.

2) Initialize device back to factory default by using "Renesas Device Partition Manager" before run the example project
   as below:
   - Open Renesas Device Partition Manager (RDPM): On "e2studio" -> Run -> Renesas Debug Tools -> Renesas Device
     Partition Manager, then choose "Connection Type" as SWD.
   - Initialize the MCU: On RDPM, select only "Initialize device" option, then click "Run".
   - The user can refer to section "5.3 Setting up Hardware" in the document via link:

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x22000650
   b. Keil:	Not available
   c. IAR:	Not available

4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release).

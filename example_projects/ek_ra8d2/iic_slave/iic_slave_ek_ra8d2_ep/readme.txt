1. Project Overview:
	The example project demonstrates typical use of the IIC Slave HAL module APIs. The project initializes IIC
	Slave and IIC Master modules with standard rate and is made interfaced with loop-back mechanism. It performs
	Slave read and write operations continuously once initialization is successful. On successful I2C transaction
	(6 bytes), the transmitted and received data are compared. LEDs blink sequentially when the data matches;
	otherwise, they are turned ON as a sign of failure. Output message for both corresponding Slave operations is
	displayed on RTT Viewer. Any API/event failure message is also displayed.

2. Hardware Requirements:

Note:
1) DTC transfer support is configurable and is enabled in the configurator. DTC is helpful for minimizing
   interrupts during large transactions.
   Note: On FPB-RA0E2 and FPB-RA0L1 boards, DTC does not support the IICA module.

2) a. For the functioning of IIC Slave on all the boards except for EK-RA6M3, EK-RA6M3G, FPB-RA6E1, EK-RA2L1,
      EK-RA8D1, EK-RA8M1, EK-RA2A2, FPB-RA8E1, EK-RA8E2, EK-RA8P1, EK-RA4C1, MCK-RA8T2, EK-RA8D2 external pull-up
      resistors of value 3.9 or 4.7k ohms are required to be connected on I2C (SDA/SCL) lines.
   b. The SDA pin and the SCL pin must configure output type as n-ch open drain.

3) Segger RTT block address may be needed to download and observe EP operation using a hex file with RTT-Viewer.
   RTT Block address for hex file committed in repository are as follows:
   a. e2studio: 0x220004b0
   b. Keil:	0x220008b0
   c. IAR: 0x220009cc

4) If an EP is modified, compiled, and downloaded please find the block address (for the variable in RAM called
   _SEGGER_RTT) in .map file generated in the project folder (e2studio\Debug or e2studio\Release, keil\Listings,
   iar\Debug\List).

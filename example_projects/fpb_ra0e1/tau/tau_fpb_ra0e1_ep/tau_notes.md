# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the basic usage of TAU driver on Renesas RA MCUs based on Renesas FSP. It consists of 7 independent operations coordinated together to create 3 sequences. They include setting the period for LED on and off times, counting external events, and measuring low-level pulse width. The user will input the required parameters for each sequence to configure the corresponding independent channel operation function of TAU. The EP information and error messages will be printed to the Host PC.

**NOTE:** To display information, users can select between the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer and the Serial Terminal (UART) with J-Link OB VCOM. By default, the Example Project information is printed to the host PC via the Serial Terminal. To utilize SEGGER RTT instead of the Serial Terminal, please follow the instructions in "Verifying Operation" section.

## Verifying operation ##
1. Import, generate and build the EP project. Note that the EP supports the Serial terminal by default.
2. Before running the example project, make sure hardware connections are done.
3. Flash or debug the EP project.
4. Open the terminal application and view output log

For using the Serial Terminal (UART):
* The soldering bridge E4 must be closed.
* Populate R10 with a resistor ranging from 0 to 150 ohms.
* Please ensure that the connection to the RTT viewer has been terminated.
* The settings for the serial terminal are as follows: The COM port is provided by the J-Link onboard, with a baud rate of 115200 bps, a data length of 8 bits, no parity check, one stop bit, and no flow control.
* To echo back what was typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].

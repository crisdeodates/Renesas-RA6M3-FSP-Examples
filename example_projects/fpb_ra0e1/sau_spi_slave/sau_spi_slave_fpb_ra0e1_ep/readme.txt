1. Project Overview:
	This example project demonstrates the basic usage of the SAU SPI driver in slave configuration on Renesas RA MCUs
	using Renesas FSP. The project follows a command protocol similar to that of the MAX31723 sensor. During the
	communication, the MCU#1, which is running the sau_spi_slave_ep project uses an IRQ to detect the slave select pin
	signal of MCU#2, which is running the sau_spi_master_ep, and MCU#1 reads commands and data sent from MCU #2 when the
	signal transitions from LOW to HIGH. When MCU #2 sends a "read data" command, MCU #1 reads the internal die temperature
	using the ADC and sends the temperature back to the master MCU #2. The temperature values are continuously printed to
	the terminal to verify correct data transmission. Additionally, status information and error messages are displayed on
	the terminal during execution.

	Note:  
	- Information can be displayed using either the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer or a serial terminal (UART) via J-Link OB VCOM, 
	  depending on availability. If J-Link OB VCOM is unsupported, the example project defaults to the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer;
	  if supported, it defaults to the serial terminal (UART).
	- To use the SEGGER J-Link RTT Viewer instead of the Serial Terminal, please refer to the instructions provided in 
	  the 'Special Topic' section of sau_spi_slave_notes.md.

# Introduction #

This Example Project demonstrates the basic usage of SAU SPI driver. The project writes commands to the slave digital thermometer module, and reads the temperature values using SAU SPI bus configured as master. The temperature values are continuously printed on J-Link RTT Viewer. Status information and error messages will be printed on J-link RTT Viewer during the execution of the project.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) 
for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of operation.

## FSP Modules Used ##
List all the various modules that are used in this example project. Refer to the FSP User Manual for further details on each module listed below.

| Module Name | Usage | Searchable Keyword  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| SAU SPI | SAU SPI is used to communicate with the digital thermometer module | r_sau_spi |
| I/O Port | I/O Port is used to drive SS_N pin of the digital thermometer module | r_ioport|

## Module Configuration Notes ##
This section describes FSP Configurator properties which are important or different than those selected by default. 

The SAU channel depend on the board type, refer to [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for information on how to select the correct channel.

**Configuration Properties for using SAU SPI**

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| configuration.xml > g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Settings > Property > Common > Enable Single Channel | Disable | 00 | Enable single channel to reduce code size if only channel 00 or 20 is to be configured for SAU SPI. |
| configuration.xml > g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Settings > Property > Module g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Channel | 00 | 00 | Use SAU SPI Channel 00 to communicate with the digital thermometer module. |
| configuration.xml > g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Settings > Property > Module g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Bitrate | 500000 | 5000000 | Use the fastest bitrate support by SAU SPI and the PMOD MAX31723PMB1 module.|
| configuration.xml > g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Settings > Property > Module g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Callback | sau_spi_callback | sau_spi_callback | A user callback function that is called from the sau spi interrupts when a transfer is completed or an error has occurred. |
| configuration.xml > g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Settings > Property > Module g_sau_spi SPI (r_sau_spi) > Transmit End Interrupt Priority | Priority 2 | Priority 2 | Select the transmit end interrupt priority. |

**Configuration Properties for using GPIO**

|   Module Property Path and Identifier   |   Default Value   |   Used Value   |   Reason   |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| configuration.xml > Pins tab > Pin Selection > Ports > P1 > P109 > Pin Configuration > Mode | Disable | Output mode (Initial Low) | Use P109 as output to drive SS_N pin of slave device during transfer process. |
